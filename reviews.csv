This phone is overpriced for even discounted price (12,999/- for 6 GB variant). I purchased it because of past good experience with Samsung (Galaxy On6) but this phone cannot match the legacy. Samsung has done too much  unnecessary cost cutting on this phone.Camera: It has an average camera. It clicks decent photos and records good videos up to 4K 30fps, fhd 60. Only the main 50 MP sensor is usable, all others are present just for count. Camera has serious bug that it captures washed out colours if its AI detects a human face while using flash. If we remove human from frame, it captures just fine colours. Also, colours are just fine while clicking without flash.Front camera is pathetic from today's standard, it will just get you with video calls and nothing more, do not expect to use it for selfies with clarity. I do not click many pictures so I am okay with its camera.You can see this issue in the attached images, both the images were captured in low light with flash, the first one came out fine with colours close to actual object while the second one has completely washed out colours because the AI in phone detected human there. This unnecessary processing ruins the joy and there is no option in camera settings to turn this off. I have spent many hours trying to avoid this with different combinations of camera settings but it cannot be turned off. This bug might be embedded deep in the phone hardware as even third party camera apps ( I tried with OpenCamera) also give the same results.Battery : It can last for around 2 days with light to medium usage. It struggles to last one full day with high usage. Exynos 1280 is not efficient considering it is 5nm chipset. Also, the phone gets warm even with normal usage ( browsing etc) and gets somewhat hot during gaming.Idle battery drain is around 8-10% per night.It charges from 8% to 100% in 4:50 hours with 5 watt charger.With 7.5w (5v 1.5a) charger, it takes around 2:55 hours.Charges in around 2:15 hours with 15 watt charger (shows as fast charging).With 25 watt charger, the phone shows as super fast charging and charges from 5% to 100% in 1:24 hours.Display : Display seems smooth with 120 Hz, obviously not punchy as super amoled but it is okay and has good brightness for sunlight use and sufficiently low brightness for comfortable night use. Viewing angles are good. I did not face any issue with display and am okay with it.Buggy Auto brightness: Samsung has a habit of using cheap virtual sensors on its devices. This phone has virtual light sensors which is just a software solution to set screen brightness according to light present in room and using front camera as the light source. But this is seriously buggy in this phone, the phone does not understand difference between complete dark and dimly lit room. So, it will apply same brightness settings to both of these situations resulting unnecessarily bright screen in dark and uncomfortably dim screen in dimly lighted room. This sensor works poorly in outdoor as well. Most of the time, the brightness it applies to screen is not adequate.Software and UI: Samsung had installed may bloatware apps which are removable, One UI as everyone knows, is pretty user friendly. So, that is okay, however, Samsung should mention that this phone does not support some of the features such as S secure, bixby routines and sound assistant which are useful for some. Otherwise software experience is good, lag free.WiFi: It supports 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi at 1x1. So max of 72 mbps in 2.4 ghz mode and max 433 mbps in 5 ghz mode. This is the most basic wifi configuration possible. It can share wifi over hotspot which is nice. Although basic, wifi will not give any issue and has good range. So, wifi is okay.Bluetooth: I did not test bluetooth range but found it sufficient for my use. It can connect to two different  devices simultaneously. However, can play music in one device only. Did not find any issue with bluetooth.Mobile network: It has good 5g support with 12 bands but supports only 1 5g sim at a time. If we set one of the sims to 5g mode, the other one drops to 4g/3g/2g mode.It supports carrier aggregation and when tested, it was working with 3 band carrier aggregation with Jio.Call clarity is good and it can record calls without announcing to other person. virtual proximity sensor is not too bad.Fingerprint reader: For this price, the performance of side mounted fingerprint reader is good enough.We can register up to 3 fingerprints only which is limiting and not appreciated, at least 5 should be given.Face unlock: I guess it has AI based face unlock which works good even in low light condition. Although I do not know how secure it is.Storage and Memory: It has 6 to 8 GB of Lpddr4x RAM which is good for this price.128 GB storage used is UFS 2.1 which is not justified at this price in 2022 and lacks in performance when compared to UFS 2.2, apps take more time to install.Gaming: I installed call of duty mobile and it allowed settings up to medium graphics with very high frame rate and low graphics with max frame rate. In both settings, game was lag free and frame rate was always below 60 fps. So below average gaming. However, I do not play games, so, did not test with other games and do not care about gaming performance.Multimedia: Display quality is okay and single bottom firing speaker is average and audio from headset jack is fine, no complaints here.The chipset used in this phone supports h.264, h.265 video codecs only and does not support VP9 and AV1 codecs which is the most annoying downside. This means that it can play youtube only till 1080p and not in 2k or 4k because youtube supports h.264 up to 1080p only and we need vp9 and av1 support if we want to play higher resolution videos and if in future youtube removes h.264 support then this phone will not be able to play youtube at all. This is a very serious issue with this device. In future, all the streaming services will eventually switch to vp9 and av1 codecs as they provide better streaming efficiency and are royalty free, but as this phone does not support those, we cannot say this will be good for multimedia in future. So, 0 points for this in multimedia.Also, if we play youtube videos in browser like brave, it runs in software acceleration mode ( again, due to lack of vp9 and av1 capability) which loads up cpu and drains battery fast. Use youtube in either Youtube app or Newpipe to prevent unnecessary battery drain (as these apps play videos with hardware acceleration, which saves power). All this nonsense applies to other OTT apps (Hotstar, Prime etc) as well as almost all of them use VP9 codec for streaming which this phone plays in software mode, which shoot up the cpu usage and causes fast battery drain ( around 15-18% per hour).GPS and navigation : Works just fine. Has compass support.Pros:Two promised android updates and 4 years of security updates.Sufficiently good display with high refresh rate, feels really smooth.Good audio, WiFi and Bluetooth.dedicated memory card slot.base variant with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage which is good.Cons:Samsung cheaping out with no charger/cover/screen protector in box while competitors provide those.5g on single sim only. Competitors provide dual 5g in even cheaper phones.inferior UFS 2.1 storage is not good at this price, UFS 2.2 should be there.only up to 3 fingerprints.Buggy camera algorithm.cheap virtual proximity sensor.buggy camera light sensor.Exynos 1280 chipset claims to be having 5nm lithography which is good on paper, but in reality, its efficiency is on par with some 12-14 nm chipset and it heats under general use. Also, I don't understand why Samsung had to omit useful VP9 and AV1 codec which wouldn't even have costed them more as they are royalty free and Mediatek Dimensity 920 with same Mali G68 GPU supports those codecs. This has resulted the phone to be not able to play 4K and 2K resolutions on youtube.No HDR playback support.
With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsung’s best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentPros Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading  of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like a screen recorder, video call effects, Game Launcher, Link to Windows, Dual Messenger, Quick Share, Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others. Some of the fancy Android 12 features, like the ability to change the color palette of icons and menus based on the wallpaper and dim the screen for easier reading in the dark, are also included.Voice focus for calls is excellent feature, phone call quality is really good even in nosiy and crowded areasI had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using Google maps to navigate,  signal stays strong even in rural areas, thats a positive point with good accuracy4g Volte with carrier aggregation works flawlesslyWifi connectivity on the Dual band 5ghz router is strong and performs  more than satisfactorily with low latency responseBluetooth 5.1 connectivity is strong and has good range  no worries of disconnection even as far as 15 metersAudio quality via 3.5 mm jack is excellent compared to Redmi note 10 pro, much more defined and well roundedFor media consumption widewine L1 support is present, Good AV experience on ott platforms, I have no serious complaints about color reproduction in videos considering TFT LCD this panel does a good enough job .Main Camera 50mp is on par and better than Redmi note 10 pro in almost all conditions, retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with HDR in photos as well as videos, it is able to handle extremely bright conditions wellEven in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colorsGood Stable videos at 1080p4k video recording is available at 30 FPS is availableMany cool camera features , boasts AR fun mode, single Take, Object Eraser and Video TNR (Temporal Noise Reduction) which makes it fun to use cameraSelfie camera has good punchy colors, Samsung's way of boosted colour processing some may like it ,some may notExcellent battery life, got 9 hours of SOT despite the heavy usage. It takes around 1.5 hours to go from 0-100, and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around 45% provided you have 25 watt Samsung’s chargerDespite summer time, phone has managed to stay relatively cool, 5nm architecture helping its cause here12 5G BandsDedicated SD card slot is a plus herePD 3.0 25 watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised 2 major android OS updates and 4 years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors, making this device more value for money in long runCons Ultrawide camera is on softer side , lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media, macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details , Note 10 pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at 4k Amoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker, but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPre-installed bloatwares like Moj, dailyhunt, sharechat, byju's are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device, but we  can expect exynos 1280  to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design , Chunky in size, carries some heft, Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer, which adds up to the value cost proposition
1.Fingerprint is useless with cover[any type] they should have built on screen or the back of phone.2. Camera is good works well3. Doesnt heat up a lot. Hardware is okay with handling  most medium use tasks and some low level heavy tasks such as basic photoshop editing not for advanced features.4. Battery stands 6 hrs usage give or take 30 min continuously youtube playback.5. The screen could have been amoled at this price{dissatisfied} but bigger size is good.Overall, the best phone for light users[yes i mean those people who dont even see the settings and dont know what most of it means(both young and old)], okay for dedicated amateurs and the tinkerbells[ people who are amateur gamers OR know the phone well and what most things happen when they make the phone do things], and lastly worse for Pros bcoz well if u are u know what i mean. Bought this for my aunt she is happy.# Finally if u are thinking of this just buy it without question bcoz u are getting similar configuration to all the Chinese smartphones. boL
Cameras decent , has issues while zooming (not clear pics )Battery is great..No ambled but the existing screen is still good.Fingerprints good.120 hz is good. But sometimes it just lags. Rarely but it does. Software updates might fix this.2 years of OS updates and 4 years of security updates is just great.If you get it around 14-15k( discounts during sale it's worth it. )Not for gamers . I don't play mobile games.Battery is just great 1.5-2 days.
I have been using this phone for almost 1 month. Overall experience is good so far. Some featurea are not available which is highly expected from Samsung. No default App Lock is provided. Network speed is not available. Music player has to be downloaded. Back Camera is good but 8MP front camera is not up to the mark. 25W charger can charge battery in 1.5hrs. Knox security is good to use. Protect Battery by 85% full charge restriction is also present. Display is okay okay in bright sunlight.
In this price range a 5G mobile is more than expected. This model proves a great hand in experience with multiple commands.On thing that took away one star was the C TO C charging cord. Either you give adapter along or just let it be as earlier don't make it desperate to be pricey.
I have order this phone on 14th January  2023 and as i have order through amazon so expecting  within 2 to 3 days however it shows February  4th 2023 and received  on 25th January  2023 still need to improve in timing but product is good in budget, looking non chinese and good brand with 5g support
If you're concerned on budget but still looking for a  5G phone without looking for slim, best camera quality and batter backup go for it.
It needs c to c adapter for charging, so which is more required,,buy alongwith adapter etc..piece is good 👍
Pro'sExcellent battery lifeSuper fast camera and fingerprint accessApps open smooth and video is very clearSpeaker is loud and can hear even over trafficCon'sSamsung has put too many of their own apps and this leads to a lot of bloatware. Overall would recommend.
Galaxy M33 5G review, Initially impression looks good feels good but heavy while holding. I am an Iphone user but to get into the Android world i need to backup my Whatsapp data. If you are an Android user then it's easy to back up Whatsapp data in google drive but for Iphone users it's not that easy. Many may be aware that Whatsapp data backup can be done using Samsung devices which run with Android 12. It took nearly 2 hours to complete data transfer from Iphone to M33 device. With datas backup, Now I can switch to an Android device without worrying about data transfering.Unboxing - Box looks slim like a Higher end smartphone, so you can't expect Charger in the box. In Box it has Handset, Sim ejector tool, Type-c to Type-c cable and warranty card.Lets see the Pros and Cons about M33Display:Pros - 120Hz refresh rate with 6.6 inch TFT LCD display and other features like HDR10+ support. It has 1080 x 2408 Resolution which comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Overall it looks like a premium mid range phone.Cons - At this price Amoled display could have been a better one.Body :Pros - Looks like a solid body built with Plastic body at the back.Cons -  Toooo heavy to hold with Phone thickness of 9.4mm and weight over 200 grams.OS & Chipset :Pros - It has a chipset of Exynos 1280 5nm processor with Android 12, One UI 4.1 out of the box. Which is good at this price range.Cons -  Snapdragon Chipset would be better.Storage :Pros - Internal storage comes with 128GB and 6 & 8 GB variant Ram and also Supports dedicated MicroSD card.Cons - NACamera :Pros - Pro mode available. Nice portrait with 50 MP camera. 5 MP Ultra wide does decent work.Cons - 50 MP camera doest take good pics some places over coloured and over shade in pic and 2 with Micro and depth given for name sake. The 8MP selfie camera doesn't take good selfies but can be used for Video calls.Battery :Pros - 6000Mah battery comes with 25W Fast charging and can be used for a couple of days for day today usage but if you're a  heavy user then maybe it lasts for 1 to 1.5 days.Cons - Toooo slow to reach 0 to 100% It takes nearly 2.5 hrs with other fast charges but with Samsung's 25W Fast charges it takes 1.45 Hrs to complete 100%Other Features :It comes with Bluetooth 5.1, Wifi - Dual band, Wifi Direct, GPS, NFC, Reverse charging and Samsung Pay in it.Conclusion :If you ask me, Best Premium mid range smartphone for overall performance but if you need to purchase it as a camera performance then you need to consider other phones with same spec.
First, I bought it (during Great Indian Festival for Rs. 14499) for my mother and she is extremely happy with it.Secondly, Samsung mentioned it has a 5nm processor, though the speed does not demonstrate that at all even after opting for maximum RAM usage (i.e., 8GB+8GB).Third, the main sensor 50mp is quite nice to click daylight images. I won't say it struggles at night as the result is 'not so bad'.Fourth, touch sensitivity is awesome. The screen is well protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 5. One must use a screen protector as the screen is quite slippery (take this as a positive point).Fifth, already updated to Android 13 and it's really a great experience till now.Sixth, the battery is HUGE, although doesn't have its effectiveness in day-to-day usage. A fully charged 6000mAh battery does not run for 2 days (even with less usage by my mother. I think the culprit is the update and hope Samsung will fix this issue shortly).Seventh, the design is good (if not great). I like the overall design language of the mobile.Hope this review helps. Take care.
Received mobile phone without power adapter... Is Samsung not providing power adapter along with mobile??
Normal
Samsung Makes Good Phones.This Phone Is Good For Normal User.Camera Is Decent But Battery Is Good.
Overall good.
Good product. Great in terms of value.I removed one start due to two reasons,1. Camera is not good for low light photography and 50 Megapixel is of no use2. I am not able to find the voice focus feature
Improve your packaging very bad packaging.  it is valuable product not soap. Please take customer product.
Battery life is ok, 8GB RAM processing speed is effective, OS version up to date, all apps working fine, messages app has autobuilt filter and blocking option of spam numbers, data transfer from old phone was seamless


                    The media could not be loaded.


 Phone is beautiful , good processing power! Only worth if you get it between 12-13k. I am a samsung lover , so bought this for dad and 5g is out here in my city. But my dad is not happy with camera.Now lets talk about cons! Yes... Camera is pathetic only good at bright sun light! Lil heavy ! Slow internet connectivity which i think will resolve after the update. I got it at 13.5 for which i am satisfied! Oh yeah TFT screen but thats not a con!! Those who are not taking it for dispaly then i must tell you i use iphone 12 and i compared the 4k videos in both and felt like m33 is more vibrant. Definately Amoled is amoled but it can be ignored!Rest up to you! Its your money ! Invest smart!Atlast just want to say too much cost cutting for just 5g! You will get loads of feautures in chinese like realme , poco, redi!!  But UI is best in samsung! You will get updates for next 2 years! good service center is another addon!Rest up to you! Its your money ! Invest smart!
Nice Performance, Poor Build Quality, Display Quality is Very Poor
Good product by Samsung under this price. Display quality should have a bit better, like amoled type.Thank you Amazon team.
If you are looking for a mobile that gets the job done for daily purposes, then this is the phone for you.For starters, I don't play any games (temple run once a while). I primarily use it for daily stuff - WhatsApp, Surfing, News, Youtube, Maps while travelling.Based on whether I am using GPS and / or bluetooth, I get a screen on time of 6-8 hours. If you charge this phone then rest assured that you will have enough battery to last the day. A full charge will typically give 1.5-2 days based on your use. I use a Samsung 35Wfast charger which I had purchased seperately beforehand. It takes typically 80-90 mins on this chatger to charge from 10-100%.I know some people complain that it's not an AMOLED display, but for me after a while it wasnt or isnt any issue.The fingerprint sensor works most of the time, except if you have sweaty fingers. The face scanner is a hit and miss and doesn't always work in darkness.The back 50MP main shooter is good in daylight at this price point. The macro camera is as good as useless.Now comes the best part, Knox security. I purchased thos phone primarily for this over chinese phones. Samsung Pass and SamsuyPay will hold your account details and Payment card details secure. No need to physically carry a debit/credit card anymore. This phone supports tap to pay for the card saved to SamsungPay.PS:My main motivation for a Samsung phone over chinese ones was a no brainer after our Soldiers were martyred in Galwan valley after scuff with Chinese PLA. I get you may jump on me that chinese brands offer a better value for money. But i wont compromise my integrity and hand money to enemy side.
Looks very cool and premium. Good features. Let's see how it performs.
Overall performance is good. Only minor lagging issue.
Over all good
Design : great but heavy at 215gm with rugged case 230-33gm, back panel get some fingerprint but not too much. Holding grip is comfortable .Display: yft lcd not ips lcd but 120hz is Smoot. Color accuracy is ok not popping like Olde or amoled. Brightness is more than enough in indore but in sunlight off angle viewing is tough.Processor & performance: multitasking is not a problem at all with 8gb ram & umcp 5.1 not ufs 2.2. Heavy games like COD mobile, apex legends playable at low graphics with max (60fps) fps. Heating issue starts after 40-50min in winter. Its not too hot to hold, you can play a game.Camera : main camera take decent photo with decenr hdr and contrast & enough detail, 50 mp mode take more detailed shot. 5mp wide angle camera at 17499 is painful but ok to have atleast samsung camera software makes the magic to actually produce a usable wide angle photo. Orher 2 mp lens forget about thats. Selfie cam take good photo with good details . Night mode on rear is okish but selfi night mode is not ok.Battery:  heavy uses at 60hz fixed refresh rate gives 7⅓ hr screen on time with highest software tweaks & optimizationpossible. With 120fps it will 6½ hr maybe. Light uses easily last for 1 day.0-100% Charging at 15watt it will take 2hr 10-15min . with 25 watt 0-100% it charges 90-95 mins.Software:  oneui is oneui where it absolutely shines. With 2 yr android update and 4yr security update. Last android update at dec 2023 and last security patch july 2026. It comes with some bloatware but most of them are uninstall able. Only 4 samsung bloatware (galaxy store,theme,max,cloud etc )and one Microsoft (one drive) can't be Uninstalled . No ads within oneui software, ads in 3rd party apps is not a fault of samsung.If you want a phone that works no matter it's specifications and security and privacy is important to you then choose samsung over Chinese brand.Smooth flawless user experience.
Adapter to be purchased separately
Only drawback is, it doesn't come with a charger adapter and camera quality is not up to the mark...
Well i am writing the review after using this phone for nearly 10 days , we my experience is as follow1.OFFER HELP ME BUYINGi purchased this device in Rs 9400 in Amazon summer sale ( including all offers) refer image attached , So for me in this price range i think this is the best what i can get2. WHY  M33 5GWell This is my first Samsung device  in 10 years of using smartphone  & before buying there are lot of negative notion against this device  but as amount and offers are tempting so i decided to buy the device , BUT i can say there is lot of noticeable difference between this Samsung device and others from MI , POCCO'S & REAL ME (BEEFORE I HAVE REALME 6) well the difference are as follows2.1. the screen :- Lots of you tubers and electronic gurus told the screen is bad , etc. etc . but  as per my usage the screen is awesome not comparable to AMOLED but better than  all other group IPS panels , i like the 120 HZ scroll feature is great .2.2. Software:- In my home there are lots of MI, Realme devices and we all have one complaint in common that is bloatware, unwanted messages due to which whole phone experience go to waste coupled with Bugs in UI, So this time after buying Samsung M33 i get rid of lot of bloatware's and unwanted advertisement2.3 Built :- built is simple and solid , i like the Rugged built with Gorilla Glass 5 protection , Over all it is good2.4. Network Connectivity :- Samsung is  very old company in telecom  as compared to these new Age smart phone manufacturer, and believe me Samsung device are far far better in connectivity as compared to other my all old devices from chinsed manufacturer always struggle with network and connectivity issues  but this device is lot better if your prime aim is to communicate and do calls2.5. sound & speaker:- There is feature of clear sound in the phone ,which is good for long time calls & speaker is loud enough for You tube content consumption2.6. Knox security :- It is very good added advantage for secure online payment , as I am deal high on online payment then this feature have very required security for day to day money transfer2.7. Battery & Processor - Processor is snappy and highly responsive and combined with 6000mha battery due to this the device is long lasting hours of usageConclusion :- I am experienced  smartphone user and always emphasis that one should buy phone as per his  or her prime requirements and I found this Samsung device M33 a well balanced  smart phone and will recommend others to buy one because the There is no alternative to network connectivity and Knox security if we compared to other devicesTHANK YOU
Samsung mobile is good
For the price this is just an ok phone. Lot of lag in touch responses. Seems to get hung even on basic phone operations and touch feedback. I am not using this for any games or heacy apps.  Just basic use for email/work/whatsapp related. Faced call drops and audio issues. While using same airtel SIM in another Samsung phone - everything is perfect. no call drop/audio issues. Not the best modem inside. Couldn't test 5G yet. no coverage in area i stay.  Adaptive display doesn't work on this phone. Unpredictable performance. Manually adjust brightness. After using stereo speakers - just 1 speaker at bottom feels very odd.
Nice battery backups
Plus :  1. Auto data switching  2. Object eraser  3. Noise reduction  4. Pic quality good  5. 6AH battery amazing  6. Finger print reader  7. 3 year s/w update  8. 4 year security patch  9. screen pixel 400ppi  10. Dual sim, men card slot  11. It’s Samsung 5GMinus:  1. Mono speaker audio quality not good, but with headset ok  2. TFT display, not smoked  3. Charger not supplied  Overall, with all merits and demerits, I like Samsung M33 5G 8/128 at Rs 17499.00
Camera is gud but photos get blurred sometime
Very good product at this price, but 50 MPX is still camera, so zoomed photo is bad. Also system app lock is disabled by samsung for this model, So other app locking apps are not working properly.
Battery pacup is very low .finger print and camera are good.
I received the mobile in good condition, the phone is working well everything is fine but  .I bought it for 17500/- what's disappointing is its without adapter ...it's a bit pricy without adapter unsatisfied by that ..otherwise it is okay
everything is OK but data cable is not in box
As said in priduct descrion battery is not upto the standard, i have been ios user from last 10 years and 5 year old morel like iphone7 battery is lasting 18 hours which is less than 2000mah and this 6000mah should last 3 days but is not the case on comparision
You should not buy this phone , samsung m series smartphone are very bad in network connectivity,  I regret after buying this phone 💔💔💔💔😢😕
WHAT IS GOOD?Smooth UIDecent day-to-day performanceExcellent Battery LifeGood DesignWHAT IS BAD?No charger in the boxBloatwareNo AMOLED DisplayNot for gaming
Value for money
Good but some times mobile hanging
Excellent
I don't like...... Just i buy because of good price... over All please don't buy
Like
It can be more better.
I'm using samsung smart phones for morethan 10 years, so I opted for M33 5G. It's giving good performance.
Best in the segment.
Nice 5g phone with high  price.Samsung must provide charger
I didn't get any USB cable in side the box
Budget Phone with ok features
Nice HD display clarity...camera takes clear snaps even in nights...120 hz refresh rate...robust battery 6000 mah lasting for 2 days after frequent usage...speaker is louder & clear...No annoying preloaded apps...No heating issue s...assured os update by samsung for two years...Decent phone at this affordable cost...👌👍
Nice
First thing first, I got worst experience of delivery with Amazon ever. As an Prime member expecting product in 1 or max 2 days I received it on 10th day. Product status was showing reached at my nearest hub but delivery agent delivered it as per their convenience and delivered me at some other location.Anyways, about mobile, It is average product, display doesn't seem to be Super Amoled. Back Camera is okay not good but many new features are there like object eraser, stickers, etc.Simply, the one who has very basic usage with phone can go for it.
I like the performance of the mobile
THE PRODUCT IS GOOD. BUT IT IS VERY BAD NEWS THAT SAMSUNG NOW DO NOT GIVE CHARGER WITH ITS . IT IS VERY BAD SIGN. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. SAMSUNG SHOULD GIVE CHARGER WITH THEIR MOBILE.
As it was in pretty attractive discount I bought this phone every features seems to be well at this cost but the phone hangs alot.
No power adapter is big disappointment from Samsung. That too in mid range.Samsung is making fun of apple but following apple like a fool.
🎀💜✨Good, impressive, excellent ✨💜🎀
1) There is problem with sound. Person on other side mostly says not able to hear my voice. It is not Tower problem as speaking to the same person at same time from other brand phones there is no problem.Whenever I have purchased Samsung the problem of sound is always there.Also it is not a Setting problem of Volume key.In previous 4 button phones the output sound was very low and I had to increase manually each time a ohoe comes. Each time a new phone call comes I have to again increase as it drops back to previous low level.2) This is the first time I purchased a Samsung Smart phone  HOPING that it will be better than its next competitor. I WAS  DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT IS NOT SO MUCH USER-FRIENDLY.IN THE SAME MENU YOU CAN NOT NAVIGATE TO DIFFERENT  OPERATIONS.3) ONE BIGGEST DISADVANTAGE OF this smart phone ( Must be true for all other Samsung Smart phone models ) is the STORAGE OF CALL RECORDINGS. IN SAMSUNG ALL CALL RECORDINGS ARE GOING TO ONLY ONE FOLDER. SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS SOME DISCUSSION WITH ONE PARTICULAR PERSON THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE HUGE CALL RECORDING LIST ,GO ON CLICKING EACH CALL AND AGAIN LOCATE THE SAME CONTACT CALL.  THIS IS REALLY CUMBERSOME AND GREAT TIME CONSUMING.I had been using the Smart phone of the Competitor so long .I very happily found that all Cal recordings are displayed below the Contact and you can easily locate the call recording and save enormous time spent in Samsung.4) TOOLS- There is NO Tools Folder . The Competitor has Tools Folder which keeps all frequently used Tools in it- Like Calculator, Scanner ,Voice Recorder,COMPASS,Clock ,Downloads etc in one place and you can quickly select that. Here you have to go on searching each.These are the reasons I say Samsungs software is much less user-friendly.I WONT BUY IT IN FUTURE.MY COMMENTS ARE FACT-BASED AND NOT EMOTION BASED OR AFFINITY BASED. AS I EXPERIENCED.5) MOREOVER this 5G is quite costly. The Charger is not being supplied with the mobile. You have to purchase it separately. So with the mobile price you must add the charger price  to find out the SET  price and compare with competitors'  . The Redmi also does not suggest what existing Charger will work ,if some one has that. ALL COMPANIES MUST SUPPLY WITH THE CHARGER AND QUOTE PRICE.I WISH SOMEONE TAKES UP THE MATTER WITH CONSUMER COURT AND THE COURT PASSES ORDER  TO ALL MOBILE COMPANIES TO SELL COMPLETE SETS ONLY IN ONE PACKING.
Good
Good product but company should provide compatible charger to extend battery life
Talking about the Camera quality... Back Camera is just Awesome and front camera is best in day light but with 3rd party application it is fine at night also.. Now move to battery part its Good enough for average user it is around 48 hours and yes when you taking long time on video call it got heated... Fingerprint reader is just ok it is little bit lagging sometime.... But after Upgrading to Android 13 its performance is even more better and 5G connectivity is also best bcz it has 12 5G supported band... Sound quality is also good in both calling and music.Conclusion: it has so many features we can't write within one post.. Just one line for it AWESOME go for it without any hesitation bcz best phone ever I have used in this price rangeNote: I am writing this Review after using 4 months i bought it at the time of dussehra and whatever I found I have mentioned everything here.NOTE:- If anyone is facing issue related to battery please replace it bcz it has best battery performance upto 48 hours even more than it.
Have rated ☆☆☆☆ as it difficult to access finger print at on go, you need to aim perfect.Touch screen is swift and niceBattery life as of now is goodOverall a nice phone
Value for money
According to the price it is good. I bought it in Big Billion day @13699. In this price 5g samsung is good one. But picture quality is not so. Also sometime performance is lagging
camra quality is not satisfactory .battery backup  is okperformance is ok
Nice phone, low budget, quality m33, many featured  phone 8gb ram, 6000mah battery, I definitely recommend this, except front camera 8mp, remaining 100%super worthy phone

 Good 👍
I bought this phone three months back. First of all I tell you the phone is very heavy and gives very uncomfortable feeling due to its weight and size. Sometimes it hangs while calling. The earphone jack stop also working partially now. In total I will not recommend the phone. It's better to go for Redmi in this range
After horrible experience from Flipkart bought this phone from amazon and got delivery on 30/09/22After using it till 11/10/22I would say this is the best decision made by me to purshase this budget smartphoneAs I got it around 13.6k with charger on sale timeSo far pros are1. Super fast processing2. Display is good for  TFT and 120hz refresh rate3. software experience4. Premium samsung features5. Original 5G support6. gaming modeCons1. Battery life is low since the phone runs 5G and being a slight heavy user I would say its okish and runs around 24-26hours with heavy usage2. the phone is slight heavy for plastic but as it contains 6k mah battery its okBut it looks premium and its a eye catcher...3. Camera should be updated***Will update this review after 3months using
Main attraction is it's 6000 mah massive battery and it's other features are also very attractive. After all the brand name is SAMSUNG - my most favourite brand.
Samsung can further lower the prices if they remove the Battery somehow. Customers can buy Battery separately.I mean seriously this is the height of manipulating prices.First they removed Earphones from boxes and now Chargers.Camera looks OK if not great.Shall produce another review soon.
If you are looking for durable phones.. m33 comes as a beast... 5g with 8+ bands.. low price some astonishing features... only con is its camera quality.. and charger is not provided with it.. Samsung should give charger with it's phones
Phone is running good
Good
Good Product but it's too much weighty
Friends, frankly this mobile from Samsung can be avoided. There's nothing special except Knox security.Those looking for big battery beware. The 6000mah battery makes this very heavy and with a tempered glass and back cover it becomes uncomfortably heavy.As for 5G, my advice is not to rush to buy 5G mobiles right now. 5G is seriously draining battery.My 4 stars are for Amazon for a safe delivery and a decent exchange experience. You will definitely not experience this with Flipkart.
* Display: Though just TFT but feels much better than most other brand's IPS. As of now it doesn't support HDR playback in YouTube but F23 in the same price does.* Performance: It has new and smaller chipset but that doesn't reflect much in performance. No lags on normal usage though.* Camera: Main 50MP camera on rear is great considering the price segment.* Build: Entirely plastic but the display has Gorilla Glass protection.* Battery: On normal usage would last 1-2days. Due to large battery it is quite heavy. With 25W charger it charges quickly.* 5G: There are other phones which have better offerings for the same price but it is a 5G ready phone unlike others.Considering its a 5G phone, overall it does the job done for the price.
The phone does not fit well in hand palm as it is too big in size. Also it is so big that holding in pant pocket is difficult.
It has been a while since i have had a phone this sturdy in this price range. The M33 5G is probably the best in its segment, with 6000 mah battery life, 8 GB ram which is expandable upto 16 GB virtually for seamless multitasking. Fingerprint sensor is amazing, unlocks the phone quicker than one can say 'wha...'. The camera is good, with multiple options like portrait, panaroma, hyperlapse, slow-motion etc. You can record 4K UHD videos at 30Fps.Talking about the build quality, this phone is on the bulky side, partially due to its big capacity battery. The phone IS sturdy, and well built. Edges are not sharp, and it feels like your are holding something powerful in your hands.Battery and Charging: The box DOES NOT COME with a travel adapter(power brick/charger) as mentioned next to the name on Amazon and Samsung's official site. Probably the only downside.It has a type C to type C cable. I purchased the 25W Samsung travel adapter, which has been working great for me. The battery charges from around 13% to 100% within 25-30 mins (i never sat next to the phone to watch it charge. Well, who does). The battery will last you a day or more  if you are not playing games( though it depends on what you play). And did i mention that it can support ANY video game title out there? Really. And on High settings as well.Talking about the interface, Samsung is using its latest ONE UI 4, and the UI is as neat as they come. I have not faced any bugs or glitches and its easy to use compared to the older versions making it a seamless experience.  Combined with Knox security, you cannot ask for anything better at this price range.The display could have been better, since most models are using AMOLED screens, but the display is not bad at all. It has 120hz screen which is great for gaming.  The screen brightness is well, very bright. Like really , really bright. The phone comes with Gorilla glass 5, so you can expect it to take a fall or two from a decent height and not worry about it.  I would recommend purchasing a screen protector and a back case so you can keep it like new for long.Side buttons are clicky and responsive. The speaker is loud but mono. The overall audio experience is very good considering that.I would recommend getting the 8 GB version for a couple of thousand ₹ more.Overall, this phone is very good in terms of performance and quality, specially with the guranteed future updates from the manufaturer. So i can definately say, so far it has been very good. Definately value for money. GO FOR IT.*It has been 10 days since i have been using the phone and writing the review.  I will edit this review if the need arises.
Purchased Galaxy M34 G5 to get a 5G compatible mobile. It has been vous of months. M33 is largely keeping me satisfied. Picture quality, though disappointed me. But all in all, worth the money. However, Samsung SHOULD provide a charger and earphone. Giving a USB C to C cable is meant less.
Good camera 📸
It is a very good product. I have been using this for 4 months. I have had an awesome experience while using itCamera 5 out of 5Display four out of 5Touch sensitivity five out of 5Calling experience 5 out of fiveMultimedia experience 4 out of five
Loved the battery backup and os stability.Newly switched to  samsung and after use of 2 months i have  no regrets
problem is the charger which is c to c pin instead
sometimes the call-receiving screen does not come while the ringtone starts ringing. A two-month-old Samsung M33 smartphone should not come with any problems.
Not so good. Phone kafi hang krta h. 1 month hue h but incoming call show nhi krta n kavi kavi off ho jata h.
Very Good product for this price range...All thumps up but not for Camera...
Camera are excellent and battery bachkup also nice
Good Product, i Defenatly Recommend this Mobile and this is budget Friendly And with its battery is the best of all And every each thing is perfectly build i loved it thank your amazon too for delivering my product wothout any miss use or damage
Phone is good, camera is just little better than average at price range. Few glitches with operating systems, need to be careful before giving any permission to any of the app like malware protection as well as these starts interfering too much with other apps functionality. Battery life is really good works well for two days for about an average office going user.
This phone is excessively heavy that I used to hold it in both my handsWhenever I keep in my hanging purse my shoulder started feeling uncomfortableAfter some days of purchasing I found some problem in clicking photos, the click button is not working at that timeI couldn't talk properly on the phone due to its heavy weight....Before this I was using Samsung galaxy A6 for 4 years.... It was such a light weight fantastic phone... Now I am thinking that my decision to go with M33 was wrong
Only problem is OS some Whatsapp feature dose not support
Nice and good
Finger prints OK and battery Super
Good
So far so good. The build quality seems good ans it’s a heavy phone. The response seem to be good. When I bough this phone there was supposed to be a 5% cash back  if we used ICICI Amazon Pay card but it seems like a hogwash since I didn’t received any money. When you are proceeding  towards checkout  it says that your card is eligible and we hope that once you’ve made the payment you would receive the cash back but it’s been few days now and nothing has come.
overall its a good 5G mobile at entry level from samsung . Don't expect too much our of it.
The Camera and Battery life are excellent and best I've ever used yet. The screen could have been AMOLED but the 120Hz LCD is fluid enough. The software needs to be optimised for the Exynos 1280 chipset though. The Chipset warms up quite a bit because of the unoptimised software, which could be improved with a future update. Talking about updates, uninstalled the Moj, Josh etc bloatware but it gets reinstalled with every update which needs to be fixed. One thing to note is that the basics are right, the antenna reception is really good. I lived in a hostel in a remote place with limited connectivity and used a Redmi device earlier which used to create problems in placing calls but with this device, the network problems have reduced drastically and now I don't face as much problems as I used to face earlier with the Redmi. Call quality is also excellent with an added perk of Voice Focus. Also OneUi4.0 even though unoptimised yet feels generations ahead of the software on other OEMs phones.
बेहतरीन उत्पाद है, फीचर्स भी ठीक है कुछ बहुत अच्छे हैं कुछ सामान्य फीचर्स मिले नहीं जैसे कि डिस्प्ले मे उपर वाले बार मे इंटरनेट स्पीड (कितने mbps या kbpsसे डाउनलोड या अपलोडिंग हो रही है) पता करने के लिए प्रदर्शन नहीं है सिर्फ नेट कनेक्ट पता चलता है मुझे सेटिंग मे नहीं मिला और मोबाइल का कवर वगैरह के साथ वजन भी ज्यादा है कैमरा भी ठीक है 50MP के हिसाब से जूमिंग मे क्लीयरटी चायनीज फोनों से ठीक है ऐसे कुछ चीजे हैबाकी इस रेंज के चायनीज मोबाइलों से इस समय यह गैर-चाइनीज़ मोबाइल का अच्छा विकल्प है
I like the quality of product and dislike being sold without charger
Not even discovered the whole phone. But looking good to me. A value product with a brand name.
Works good. Quality OK
Nice
Reliable product and battery life is as per my expectation
This device is very good according to that's price
Battery life not good. Battery draining too fast. Camera quality not good. Weight is more. From past 20 days just going to customer care everyday. Non responsive service... Worst from samsung.Visited service canter at gopalpura byepass, jaipur. They changed the battery. Now the phone is working quite good. Thanks to service center.
Super camera!!
Overall a good 5g phone with good battery, better camera and good performance.
Its just 6 days since I received the 6GB RAM version for my son on 19 Sep 22 after reading some pretty decent reviews. Its still early days to pass judgement but so far so good! The big difference is its LCD screen Vs the newer AMOLED tech. However keeping an AMOLED besides this on the same image, couldn't make out too much of a difference with the naked eye. And that's the point right?However what surprised me was the derogatory feedback of the salesman at the Samsung store at a nearby Mall for the whole M series. Like, this is a cheap variant made just for Amazon. So obviously it will have a whole lot of compromises. When I called his attention to the  6000 mAh Battery, his response was obviously, it was required as the not so fine-tuned hardware consumes more battery therefore larger power is required. Is all that true?
I find it bit heavy, but it's on the usage. Battery life and camera is good
Honest ReviewI bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly. Experience -1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.The voice focus function is good.5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.7. There are some really small good featureslike samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.No charger
Value for money good battery good camera 📷
Very nice
Such Camera with this huge Battery backup and with this kind of processes at ghis price is impossible to get.....5g works great 12 band of 5 g
I just saved ki motherboard warrenty period me hi kharab hua....other brands k phone me motherboard kahi kharab nhi hote aur samsung me brand name and brand value k baawjood 7 mahine me motherboard kharab ho gya....Bhagwan ne bachaya is baar to....agli baar se trend me chal rahe phones le lunga but samsung nhi le rha
I have opted for 8gb version, liked it! worth under a budget of 20k. The camera quality is great but not exceptional. The images are very clear.Battery - fast charges in 1.2hrs - can last long easily for two days of moderate usage. less to no usage last long till 3-4 days. heavy usage will give enough nearly a day.Gaming - not a gaming phone, yet can play medium size graphics games easily without lag, phone doesnt get too hot nor it get hotter quickly. battery backup is quite good so it would easily last long for hours.design - will fit in your pocket easily and have a good bright screen as well. not an OLED but a Full HD screen that can provide a max resolution of 1020p but not 4k.Overall - try buying this phone when it has offer. its worth a shot.
Very good mobile phone, Ram was too much.. Display was very good, faster and smooth, Internal memory was sufficient. Latest and smallest exynos processor was too good. 6000 mah monster battery was good...Overall Awesome experience..
Phone is quite heavy battery backup also very poor.. Average product
Finger print reader is not very convenient
Very good budget phone in class
Battery backup  nothing
Camera quality is best. Battery goes 2 days on normal use. Phone is sometimes auto unlock saying fingerprint reader is dirty. 4g data is quickly finished in comparison to 4g mobile phone.  It's not that much overweight to use in one hand . Overall It's a good phone at this price
Great phone under 15 kGood things :5g phone with wifi callingGood battery back upCons:Phone is heavy
For the price, the M33 is a good purchase. I use it for calls, messages, watching videos and making videos. The battery life is satisfactory for normal usage. Battery goes down sooner when I use the phone for making videos, but that is not a surprise. Overall, I am satisfied with this phone.
It's a good product which is made by Samsung, But on this phone, i noticed a issue, it heat up very fast and it's automatically switched the sim card to emergency mode, through which.. no phone call will reach to you.But the camera quality is good.
Overall phone is good  but Its overpriced.Ideal price  for  8gb/128gb should  be  16000 to 17000
Samsung phone ordered and received in time and good packing .That phone M33 5G is best quality,works well for best camera.
Very good product  & good range phone 22oct22 purchased. Adopter & earphones not available with phone.
Phone is ok ......processor is slow ......better than Chinese brands. I purchased it because it is not Chinese and indian brands are not strong.
Good  product  by Samsung at the budget  price..
This mobile is good but when I am typing the touch response is not accurate.
Good phone in 15k price range
Battery
Ok
Samsung galaxy m33 is better than other 5g mobile. But company should improve its Back camera quality. Overall features are very good in this mobile.
Its a budget friendly phone got one for my sister during diwali offers..in amazonThanku amazon
only some minor heating problems while video calls
this phone batter than other by its specification and features like premium phone and no other problem with it
Good for ones who do not use for work
I love it this product 90% satisfaction balance 10% no charger and no back case also
This phone is amazing and very budget-friendly.
Very nice product but very unhappy Customer first time with Samsung. Associated more than.a decade but this policy is rediculuous.Cost cutting is good practice but not at the cost basics. No battery charger is in the pkt. Moreover surprise is the charging cable is not combatible with my old charger. No charger different charging cable .Means buy a new mobile but u cannot use is. New charger will cost u 1200 extra.Very bad policy. I will never ever buy again.
One of the best 5G phones under 20K from SamsungSimple design, good utility and super smooth operations.Quick charging and impressive battery life.Front camera could be better.Display though not AMOLED, is very impressiveGood value for money
Good quality mobile
Good
Need to fixed problems of hanging.There is allot of space but this mobile somtime surprisely hanging.
Internet working too much slow please suggest some one what I need to do?
It has everything for normal user like me. But sellers are not providing genuine seal of packing. I received phone and found its one seal was broken but 2 other seals were ok. So suspected that it is genuine or not or refurbished. I hope it is genuine.Photo quality is excellent.Battery backup when you charge it 100% at 6 am and use internet, game etc. moderate use the it will discharge up to 50% by 3 pm. Means it has super backup. Phone is fast. Touch is excellent. Overall network coverage is excellent.
Phone is very heavy. Crosses 250 gms with lighter back cover.Battery life is very average, Xiaomi smartphones 4500 mah equals samsung 6000 mah.Rest things are decent but can be improved.
At a time I purchase is Rs 13999/- (include carging adaptor worth Rs 1000/-) now it's rate goes up, so for me it's quite good deal, overall product is good , but main problem is with samsung k saare mobile hang Hote hai , phir samsung g ka phone 10000/- ka ho yaa phir 100000/- ka ho
I was very confused that which company model is fulfill my criteria. I check in youtube compare many mobile at last after 1 month i purchase m33. Its right decision by me to buy the mobile. Go for it
Worth at this price
He is very good mobile
Lag free and smooth UI experience. Performance also good for average user. Battery life is excellent.Camera quality - POOR. NOT WORTH THE PRICE AND HYPE.
Phone's build quality is very excellent.  And camera is quite good.Phone is Excellent. Phone is also light weight. You must go through this.
No charger provided,which causes real problem.otherwise product is good enough
Replace the product with newer edition
My rake after using it.While the ram, storage, refresh rate is great. The screen display is goodWhat just kind of sucks big time is speaker and camera which is just kind of average.However what makes you feel cheated by Samsung (wish I could right this in bold) is the type C cord which doesn't have a USB side to it to plug in another existing charger or laptop. By this you are forced to pay extra for the adapter which is steep.And yes like Redmi, realme, asus which I have bought earlier, they don't provide a protective back guard cover with the phone.. so once again pay extra there.These are purely my observations .. serious don't care if you differ in opinion
Except camera quality , everything is as it says
good
good phone only  negative  tft display which should have been led display
Smooth Touch, good battery, camera good, sound and display awesome
Fingerprint nahi chalta
Okay
Good
Okokproduct
Satisfactory experience
Decent phone in the price range....Display could have been Amoled....Fingerprint sensor is quite fast but there is some problem with face recog. When there is low light...Camera quality is also decent enough but 64 MP primary camera would hve been better and front one should also have been atleast 16 MP....but again its good enough and also it is not chinese company phone
Heavy weight, battery good. Display, camera can be improved. Some of the 4K videos stutter to play. But for the price of 14.5k plus cards discount and exchange offer, it's a steal. Android 12, fluid opening of apps, no hangings.Con : Couldn't install Hotstar ott app due to non compatible of software version. Samsung helpdesk said the same. Hotstar app is not shown in playstore for this mobile model. A very red card 👎👎. Hopefully they come with update in near future.
Its good quality phone but travel adapter is not there you have to purchase it separately @ Rs.1690/This is too high. Samsung should give it along with phone only. In last week court has order Apple also to provide adapter charger to all customer. Samsung should also do it. Other wise people will stop buying other company phone.
ALL IS WELL IN THIS PRODUCT
thge phone is good and delivered as expected
Very good product
Cons : Phone was heavy (over weight).Pros : Batter, performance, touch screen are good.Suggestion : Please go for 8 GB RAM instead of 6 GB RAM, you will find the increase in performance.
Excellent
C pin to c pin cable found, one hole is found on phone, I don't  know where is other hole??? While discharging the all battery the new phone will be kept in cupboard. Why charger not given by Samsung? If the environment issue of plastic, Samsung Kya charging ki dabbing degassing Kyada? Whiteout packaging they sold their product?
It is a good device but the battery backup is not good, I know that it has the big battery but still backup is not good. And the main thing which disappoint me that the major android updates, when I heard that it will receive only 2 Major Android update I was totally shocked. It has a 5NM processor and have the capacity to receive 3 Android update but what can I do it's all about the company thing. The OS is also not well optimised and not light. I was supposed to buy other Phone but thought that Samsung gives long update support but it discriminates better phones also.
Display of Galaxy M33 5G is very very worst.
Very nice phone. Display is very good
Please camera quality extra and display adaptor high rate so please provide adoctor all set Samsung
overall good product & meets my expectation. battery life is too good. only Samsung don't provide adapter is hectic. overall phone is good. too many other functions are there in mobile. fingerprint sensor is very quick. sound quality is also good. overall product meets my expectation.
Got this phone as a spare phone to have Indian sim card on it and to use during our trip to India. The phone itself is a bit bulky and rather heavy. The display on the other hand compared to our other spare phone (the M31's LED) isn't any bad at all as this one has an LCD and 128 Hz refresh rate which is pretty decent. Battery is not yet tested much, however it seems to last for days with Wi-Fi turned off and with Wifi ON it seems to last for 2-3 days at least. Since it has not been put to real use of a primary phone which we may do when we travel we are quite skeptical about it. Haven't tried to listen to music, watch videos or play games tbh. We had to uninstall the loads of Samsung bloatwares off which was quite necessary. The box lacks adapter which might be a bummer for a few. However since I live abroad I don't have a need for the adapter. The other trouble is the idea of having finger print scanner on an odd place. If you have a case then the finger print scanner gets intruded a bit.  But for whatever reasons, perhaps due to the display, camera, simplicity of the android UI etc., my wife kind of gets curious to try it over her iPhone XR. We will try to use it with an NA sim card in the upcoming days and I will post an update by then.

 Best at this price range . functions smooth and there is a lot to discover in this phone .. many good features are availableOnly drawback is battery.. it's not as mentioned (6000mAH) .. seems to be only about 4500 .. but yes that's also not badMust go if u r a feature lover not a design lover!!PS: No charger in box
very nice
Handset's performances fine.. but speed of charging is utterly low comparing with other devices.. it will take more than 2 hours to fulfill the battery ..
Battery is good.Camera is good.Performance is great.Phone is really heavy.
Volume is very low
Read multiple reviews etc and brought the phone. This is my 1st Samsung phone, Never had a Samsung Android phone before.Just listing the Cons I noticed:1. Finger print sensor is not that great. The sensor button is so small, If you have a Silicon cover it is difficult as your finger is blocked 80% and you have to put some efforts to touch it and get it accepted. I used MI phone before and had a dedicated large finger print sensor in the back and feel that was good as the sensor was accurate and had a large surface area.2. Android 12 is great, But is slightly sluggish. If you used a faster phone before, then you need to get used to the minor slowness. It is slightly slow, But not bad.3. Camera is OK, Again if you want to shoot photos then you need to buy I-Phone or a Higher priced Samsung phone.4. Battery is 6000maH, But seems bit it drains faster, But still is not bad. If you are using it very frequently with some Intense Apps running in the background (Not Gaming) then will last for 1 - 1.5 days max.5. 5G Network selection is only possible with 1 sim at a time. I did not get the option to select 5G Network on both sims at the same time. Once you select 5G on one sim, then the same is removed from the other sim and becomes 4G.Overall it is a decent phone and if you get this on a discount then go for it or you can look for better options.
Camera function is not good speciall front camera.
WOW

Perfect
I got this phone very recently during Amazon Big Billion Diwali Sales for 15,499/-. Initially I was a bit skeptical ordering online but reading so many previous reviews made me go for it. I tried to getting it offline but those stores which I contacted with in my city were not having this. The phone arrived and I was surprised to see that the C type cable had both the ends like C Type only. Thankfully I got another cable from my sister. I have now been using this phone for 2 weeks now and I am happy to have this phone. This phone has enough space and ram for my major activities. The only drawback I think is the camera of this phone. The Camera is not that great when compared to Samsung S21 model. But then I use phone mostly for internet purpose and my communication purpose majorly. Occasionally whenever I am taking photos, I am satisfied that I dont have to delete my older photos for making space to newer ones due to space problem. This phone is a good deal provided one has managed to buy it during online offers. Rest is up to the user. Each user will have different opinions. I shared mine too. :)
Good one. Charging status not visible on locked screen
Like
Bought it as a gift to another person. It works great. Value for money from a branded company
Complaint of problem in mobile:  (1) No voice is hearing from other side and no voice hearing on other side on mobile during communications from last one week. (2)  If power off and start again, then communications done for few time of duration and same problem happened. Please solve this matter and return this mobile.
Good product
I have one problem  app lock
I am given review after using of 1 month phone. Camra quality is not disappointing me..over all performance is good.
Samsung M33 not great but Ok.1. Camera 50mp quad! My 5 year old sony mobile(23mp single lens) for better than Samsung.2. I did not feel camera like 50MP, My personal view camera picture quality is very poor, even 20mp cameras take better picture than this.3. Unwanted software installed in the phone, which i am not able to remove. even cant move to SD card!.4. battery is OK mine is new pone one charge getting almost 2days back up5. At this price range i dont think it is a great phone. since there is no sony in india and i dont wanted to go for cheap chines brand purchased this phone. overall ok phone6. finger print work well, some time dont.7. display Ok , not great. again my 5yr old phone wins here.
Updated on Oct 24th 2022, do not buy this as you will notbe able to do exchange offer on any new mobile...Mobile is good with what it comes with like 6/8 GB of RAM and also with 4/6/8 gb of additional virtual RAM, which needs 4/6/8gb of storage utilization from your 128GB of huge storage..which is actually great..Performance wise yes its good but the chip been used may last only for one or two years.. who cares after 2years.. mobiles are out dated on released date itself.. so this doesn't matter..Cameras are at most good but front camera not good.. so phone is not for SELFIES..Screen:there are plenty of comments,videos and blogs that phones screen is not good.. but those reviews are totally wrong and have been provided before phone's release date,without having phone in hand..thats not good... But yes, screen is not value for money you are paying...but its comes with great refresh rate and colors are fabulous..Chargers: am pretty sure each family member have good or say average phone with c type charger in home now, so why to waste money..there is no point of buying new charger.. its not atall bad thing..but yes at this price, charger would have be part of box..Other great stuffs like wide angle camera,gaming performance, weight, body and build quality, touch n feel..all good..Overall for 2 to 3 years use with budget less than 20k..go for it.. i got on offer on first day sale..so it was less than 17k for 8gb variant for me..great deal..
product is good to deliver in good condition I am very scared when we order but after the delivery of the product, I m fully satisfied.
Good
Like design and battery back up.
Charger no include with phone.charger cost is so high rs 1500
I liked the phone but battery life not upto mark can play big games for long times with battery still coming 1 day but not 2 days
Nice

Good mobileBut selfie camera not good
Good features
Nice phone in economic segment
Recently I purchased M33 phone from Amazon. Delivery experience was good.Price was 20k but in Amazon sell I purchased in 14k. Impressive phone. Samsung has provided lot of features in this phone competitive to Chinese phonesPros1. Excellent Battery life  due to 5000mah2. Screen resolution is excellent eventhough it is not  Amoled.3. Good refresh rate4.Good camera5. 5G phone with 12 bands.6. One can increase RAM upto 16 gb7. You can uninstall additional installed apps( In Chinese phones you can't)Cons1. No charger in the box so one need to spent Rs 1200 additionally.2. Phone is heavy and big sizeWhile choosing this phone main competitor was Real me Narzo Pro 50 .I will say it is like a Hero Splendor as it offers all required features in optimum cost.I am proud that I purchased Indian manufactured phone.
Compare to  F23 5g processor M33 5g processor is slow but ok ...all good in this price
This phone is terrific battery backup and dolby sound but if you are pubg lover and pic lover .. this is not for you .. camera clarity is below average and gaming experience is very poor.Not having any gaming boost or special future..Display quality also below average  ...If you are flagship phone user please do not buy this phone ...
Due to LCD screen it is very thick and bulky
Value for money
Too early to comment as it is only 2 days since I bought. First impression is that it is a very good phone. Battery backup is its usp. Smooth to use. Vivid colours while watching movie or youtube. Camera quality seems an immediate letdown. Good phone overall.
Very good battery
Samsung says that they give warranty for 1 years but literally there is no warranty.  If there is any issue in between warranty period they also charges money.
Purchased 8GB option for my mother and overall it's good buy at 17K after discount. Following are some of my experience sharinh after using it for 3 days:Pros:- Big 6.6 screen but not heavy to be honest. Ocean blue was cool pick.- Massive 6000 mah battery, I need not charge for first 28 hours inspite of heavy usage- Camera is descent and taking good pictures from both front and rear. Please don't expect to click like Samsung flagship- overall good display inspite of TFT LCD. Was pretty bright and smooth thanks to 120 hz refresh rate- Daily usage between multiple apps was handled pretty smooth including streaming in Netflix Amazon hotstar etc- Not much gamer so cannot comment on this- liked Android 12 and latest one Ui 4.1 and haptics is really goodCons:- Amoled could have been provided at this price range. Samsung need to learn from realme and oppo- No charger adapter was disappointing. Need to spend extra 900 rs for same- Even though bottom speaker was pretty loud, stereo speakers could have been provided in this range- Always need to press side button to on display. Double tap on screen is not available hereOverall if you want Samsung only at this price range then can go for it without second thought. Otherwise you have realme or oppo or poco if you want amoled  screen charger, dual stereo speakers etc...
Easy to operate
Amazing phone with maximum features. Good camera, good screen size make it look more amazing.Go for it..!!
It was not enough
Truly FHD+Display is awesome, Smooth touch experience, Software optimization are Exellent. Processor speed, and wifi network speed awesome for long uses. Till now no heating issue shown in handset. Memory management are awesome, Mostly many small awesome features also available in new midrange and High range Models. Also picture quality are decent. So overall experience area Excellent.
super phone
Fantastic phone friends.I did a lot of research before buying this phone and i am loving it. Dont get influnced by blogs and youtubers who are paid by chinese to sell oppo vivo redmi xioami or Motorola, one plus.This phone is a machine. Its heavy cuz of 6000mh battery is worth every penny. I was worried about lcd screeen, but samsung proved that their lcd screen is equal to cheap chinese phones.Speed is brillaint, easy to handleSamsung knox security is boon. I was safeguarded from tracking and voice focus is so clear and exynos chipset is fast.Brilliant phone, i bought it at 18.5k and now its 20.5. Guys, dont for chinese phones. Beleive in samsung, they are way ahead than these cheap brands
The phone is good , the money  was spent on this.
Front and rear camera picture quality not satisfied
Good
Very nice samsung mobile m33 but camera not good .
It hasn't amoled display. Its fast, camera quality good, fingerprint reader works good, smooth touch.
Its very good in using
Dislike- This phone is more weight than normal mobile.Carry pant pocket is more problem.Like- Battery,camera,speed etc are good.
Marvelous mobile, but not giving charger with it just like serving meals in hotel without salt.
Camera quality is good at this price segment battery is also good after 2 weeks of usage am writing this review.
Discount package so didn't get plug, ear phones etc.
Camera quality could be little better compared to other configuration of the phone, but overall this phone is a good choice.
Good quality... Happy with that
I brought for 12500 in big billion  sale .very nice 5G phone with all options 👌. Go and grab it.
camera quality is great, battery life is good too. easy to use. overall a nice product.
Picture needs to improve

Camara is not good.
I bought this phone at ₹16499 after instant discount of ₹3000 on ICICI Bank credit card. So at this price point, it's a good deal. Now I have divided the pros and cons in the list below after using it for around 24 days.Pros:1 Good battery life2 Decent back camera3 Type C port4 It has a headphone jack5 Capability of NFC functionalities6 Smooth UI7 It has 5G capability for future8 It has Gorilla Glass 5 protection for screenCons:1 Speaker loudness and clarity is not satisfactory2 Back is plastic, not metal3 No notification LED4 Phone is a bit thick and heavy, I guess due to big battery of 6000mAh5 Has a number of pre-installed apps6 Doesn't include charger in the box, it has to be purchased separately7 It also didn't include a basic back cover or even a simple screen protectorSo, these are basically my observations and opinions about what the phone offers in practical use. I may update these pros and cons upon further experience.
Brightness 🌞 is little low compare to Amoled Display. but Tft Display is Good quality overall good product 👍
Delivered 09-Oct-2022Purchased Samsung Galaxy M33 5G (Mystique Green, 8GB, 128GB Storage) | 6000mAh Battery |Upto 16GB RAM with RAM Plus |Return window closed on 16-Oct-2022Based on past  good reviews i purchased above Smart 5 G Phone .Battery draining too fast very very worst mobile .Automatic switches off. HangsI recommend not to go for this PHONE unless seriously SAMSUNG resolves the issues .AMAZON/Samsung should give the replacement  & extend it up to one Month replacement free of Cost similar brand or other brand option.One week is too short for replacement. Somebody like me gifted it to my Sister.By the time , my sister started using it was 18th Oct.
It's been a week since I bought this phone..There are some pros and cons which I experienced are listed below..PROS:1. Though it's LCD Screen, the picture quality is good and smooth 120Hz screen with good viewing angles.2. Best Android UI.3. You feel like Samsung is (iPhone in android) bcoz of it's battery optimisation and smooth software.4. I'm charging my phone only to 85% bcoz I'm keeping my phone in battery protect mode..My boy is coming down to 25% after two days of medium usage.. So it's good.. Best battery life you can see in this mid range.5. It's a okish camera and 8mp camera seems to have more clarity than 16mp selfie camera..6. Having HDR support.CONS:1. Phone is heavy it's nearly 215 gms..2. Charger not included..( Samsung must understand that people who are buying smartphone under 20k expects charger in box. And there may be some people who are buying phone after 5 yrs. )3. For 6/128gb variant it costed me 19.5K for phone+charger+case+temperd glass...So keep budget like that..Atlast.. If your smartphone need is like good software and battery life with promising android update means go for this phone instead of POCO X4 PRO 5G.If you need gaming means go for POCO X4 PRO.
Display not good
Good
Dislike the weight. Camera average. Other wise ok
Not bad...value for money
Performs good but crashing suddenly sometimes worries me
Normally phone
Camara is good quality
Delivery : It takes 10 days to deliver. Perhaps it is due to Great Indian Sale at AmazonCondition : Received in sealed pack. No complain about product conditionI am writing this review after 7 days of deliveryBuild Quality : I am facing no issue. Build quality is solid. But remember you cannot break stone with it.. after all it is not hammer,Display : A simple TFT display but with good brightness. I feel not much difference with amoled display in my simple naked eye. After all I am not tech savvy and can sacrifice  only time display or fingerprint display which Amoled can do. It is wok fine with me.Software: It is Android 12. Samsung guaranteed 2 major update.. And of course Android 13 is coming soon and one can get this update with this phone. I feel no lag in Software.Finger Print Sensor : People say finger print censor is not good. Bu I have register my three finger and it is working fine. I don't know why other people facing issues .Sound: Yes stereo sound is not there. Mono Sound is loud.Overall It is performance oriented phone. If you are not game savvy and use it just for your professional or working purpose it is good and best phone.

Nice Phone,Whatever you can get in this price you will get it.A basic android/ Samsung user is looking for dual sim, additional memory card, good video experience, all day battery backup without power bank, stylish mobile in hand, finger print and a good Camera.Everything is in one phone in a affordable.Go ahead with this phone, i got it in 16499 when there was some offers going on credit card. Value for money.Now its showing 18499/- still a good price for it.
Good phone for general uses.
my concern was absence of amoled but display is soo good that it feels like amoled set at natural mode, i means surprisingly blacks are inki black with no white noise on screen, colours are very natural, lamanated, very happy....used 5G jio trial...could get upto 857Mbps....speaker is good, call quality with voice focus is excellent , camera is camera, battery is nice though drains a wee bit faster on 5G network since it uses more frequencies, can handle a bit of heavy gaming too, overall a decent device apt for multiple years usage as 2 major android updates and 4 years of security update is coming too

As per my experience overall good product for this amount. Charger and earphones  is not provide.If it is available is good. We are using other caharge not comfortable for this make damage. Please provide charger with phone
Phone is good. The inclusion of amoled display would have been much better. This phone will serve someone who isn't a heavy gamer. Delivery service needs to improve greatly.
Good
Charger Adapter & Case Covor not in the box.So fool
the product is good all over though they don't provide adaptor.. they only provide a cable which is not useful at all.. otherwise the product is awesome.. but the only negative thing is you have to buy the adaptor individually.
Phone is extremely bulky, like holding a power bank or hard disk. Not a good-looking phone.  No Amoled display, it sucks without it.Camera is exceptionally worst, blurry and full of noise. Colors are not good even in daytime.Slight stutters while using for long time or doing updates and all.Speaker is very loud but No Bass.Rest all if fine120Hz full hd display is good, battery is good, charging speed with 25watt charger is 1hr 25mins, fingerprint is very fast, has knox security, ALT-z, secure folder, samsung pay, NFC, and all the features you can ask for.Just a Okay-Okay phone, thats all
Phone too heavy only but other features are very good ok
It's a good one under our budget,
Everything was good but travel adapter is not provided.
This phone hangs is too much & Slow. But Battery Performance is Good. Camera is also good according to the price.
Best Mobile in 15k with 5G network
Without charge phone is useless
Phone is excellent in terms of user experience but lacks at camera quality and battery life. Worst part is the finger print sensor placed at home button ,indisplay sensor could be a better one.
In this budget overall good phone
Overall phone is good
Good buy as far as mid budget smart phones are concerned
Value for money
Product is ok ....but without mentioning Axis Bank taking processing fee for credit card EMI Conversion all other banks are mentioned about the fee. Axis Bank is cheating their customers.
Nice
Good price
Very good quality. Clear voice n quick response
Nothing changed in terms of display.  Camera average.
It's a decent looking phone and thanks to the Samsung One UI, it shares the same look of Samsung's premium phones. Samsung has thankfully cut down on the bloatware and so fewer unnecessary apps to eat up the storage. Good buy for the price if you are not looking to buy Chinese phones.
Loved the mobile with build, battery backup, camera quality,Amazon Pro: Delivered right on time, and easy hand over by delivery person. Hats off to them for being timely in such hot summer.Amazon Con: This was delivered with just a hard paper box. I ordered sony BT headphones in past, it came with secured package. With this mobile it was just a hard corrugated box package. Not happy at all.Samsung Pro: They got the best product in this price range. A real Value for money.Samsung Cons: 1. Should have included a complete set of accessories like wired headphone, adaptor. It is not too much to ask for. This is my first samsung, maybe in future I'll think of buying a product with all accessories included in box. Hope it reaches to Samsung and will be considered for other incomplete packed product range.2. Device heats up while charging. Maybe due to recent hot Indian summer, such devices should be designed by keeping this point in mind.3. Audio jack should have been placed on top instead of bottom.
In the description of Samsung M33 5G it was promised that the box contains data cable, ejection pin and guide book along with the set. But have got only mobile phone. Nothing else. Will the sellers provide me with the rest items?
Camera is worst and phone is very slow compared to other 4gb ram phones..(mine is 8gb)
No issues at all after using it for around a month and meeting all expectation
best phone under 20,000 I'm writing this review after 1 month camera is so good battery life is also great good phone for normal use
I miss Amoled display and the LCD is just ok. Apart from that everything is just good.This is a good mobile for folks who just use mobile for music or binge watching or using for calls.(Like my parents)
Camera, battery and display are desentSamsung may resolved all drawbacks from old M seris
Received the phone in good condition. No issues till now. Phone is working as expected.
Worst Buttery life and normal camera quality
Charger not in box Negative point
Front camera is bad

Good product . Thank you amazon . But adopter is  not here this is a main problem . But almost this product is good and nice.
Good camera and 5g at affordable price
Didn't receive Charger adapter for Samsung A32
Pros1. Good looks2.good cameraCons1. Software glitch like incoming call not shown in screen2. Not very sturdy, if phone drops high chance of screen breaking3. Charging is inconsistent and not proper.4. Phone gets hot very first
I am writing after 11 days of use.Overall phone is good.
Product is good, value for money
The camera quality is poor in low light, the battery life is good, and the rest of the phone is good.
charger and headphone to be included
Samsung is known to every one.First charging had lot of heat generation, now it seems OK.
I like all but in display LCD that only I dislike
Khub akta Kharap not, but if they are provide super amoled display then the phone feel awesome
Like: quality, touch screen 👌Dislike: camera, charging,  little heat

I Bought this phone for ₹13599  6-64GB And Its worth Its Cost.... Nice Phone ...Its Battery life is Very nice.. I  play COD for 2 Hours Continued And Its Loses Only 10% aproxx battery .. Everything in best in this price ... Except its weight and Some minute Software Issue
good
For the data cable, who gives ctype both the ends. I feel shouldve been the usual way.Setting up device was easy. We are yet to use the phone for complete review of the phone.
I bought this phone 20,000 there is no offer I have not used m series my past, sound is coming very high, satisfied with tuch very fast this phone is 13 or 14,000 ok, there is no charger, I feel phone is bit weight.Don't buy 20,000 if there is offer 13,000 or 14,000 it will ok to go for buy.
While purchasing a brand mobile, you can't imagine that the mobile comes without its adopter. And cable is C to C so you have to purchase the mobile charger separately.
Best 5g phn in range
Can't recognize face for face lockBattery is good 👍Design and colur is also goodCamara is OK don't expect muchNight time cemara Is average
Camera quality very poor
It's a very good phone for the price. Fits our requirements in every aspect.Samsung should continue to provide the adapter along with the charging cable as it did in the past.
Very good product in this price range  .
Overall good product! but 24 sept ko book karne k baad 04 oct ko items received ho raha h. Company ki taraf se ispe dhyan diya jaye
I have been using Samsung note series since Note 1 days and hence didn't had much expectations from m33 as second phone. But it packed some good surprises like a bright screen, very decent camera (for its price point), awesome battery, peppy design and 3 card slots + 3.5jack (I need the card slot which is now not there in flagships, hence I needed this phone).But it also has snobby Samsung signature mistakes. To mention a few -1. Just too much samsung Bloatware2. No full fledged multi profile support like stock android. Only secure folder of Knox.3. Manual adjusting of display brightness. This is the most annoying thing. Even 10k phones these days has auto brightness4. Software bugs - after accepting a incoming call at times I'm asked for permission for microphone access!5. Occasional lags6. No Dolby Atmos, no digital audio7. No amoled, though colour is quite punchy.8. Wifi and Hotspot can't work together.9. Speaker volume fluctuating of its ownMost of these can be fixed with software updates and hope Samsung will be doing that.
Ordered a few months ago and is working excellently. Great picture, no lag, good camera. Overall very satisfied.
Working goodDisplay and camera averageRest all good
The phone was OK, but the delivery time is too long, Amazon only takes care of their prime members but did not give importance to non-prime members, it took 14 days to deliver my product.
Samsung is a well-known brand and one of the largest selling smartphone companies in the world. This M33 5G smartphone therefore can't go wrong vis-a-vis customers looking for a state-of-art fully-loaded phone for a competitive price. The performance is brisk. Battery is amazingly long-lasting. Speed and storage match any latest arrivals in the market. I would rather the phone company had packed and sent a 24W fast-charging-adaptor along. When you sell an elephant to a customer, it's so natural that you sell them the small magic wand that help control the pachyderm. Right?
Mst camera mst preference
Battery is as expected,camera too... They don't give you charger so I bought one for 430... there is no shortcut for taking screenshot so you have to stick to the old school thing like holding the two buttons together and one of them is your f8ngerprint sensor...that's weird and there are many more things that you are troubled by if you have been an MI user...coz MI phones are so user friendly... but overall not too much troubled with it... sometimes it gets hot 🔥 like rarely but it does...
No other phone in 15.5k rs. can give you this many awesome features. Samsung does a lot of R&D. loved the phone. Audio quality is good and louder than most other phones I've used. Had to compromise with the tft display, but the tft is not that bad either, not disappointing. If you are a person who likes to use their phone fast, then this is for you. The phone makes sure you have the required features at your disposal to make your work easier and efficient. Brightness is good, but nothing compared to superAmoled. All in all samsung beats all other phones in this segment in terms of software. Go for it.
I had been using M 31 for quite some time now , had a cracks on the screen that's why this one.ProsBig phone ( subjective)Back panel is good compared to M 31Speakers are goodFingerprint sensor works fastAnd batteryConsDisplay is ok not good ( no amloed)Phone is heavyNo adapter ( don't know why Samsung does that in the segment)Software is Android 12 out of the box and one UI 4.1 is good.Camera is again subjectiveSelfie camera is not goodMain camera unit is ok by not something grt.Call reception is goodAnd the SAR value is on the high side with the handset.Thanks
I liked the  camera  quality  nice  battery is  also  nice  and long  lasting  but near camera  sometimes  I  get  heat but body  will be  coolAnd I liked  because I am  rough and  tough  user  I am review  after  use of 3 monthsVery  nice  product  Very  worthy  full
This one is a good value proposition battery is fine camera is ok display is decent but  slightly heavy and can't make much sense of  the dumb both side type C USB cable.stupid innovation.
It's a good phone.User friendly.I've been started using it for the past two days.
phone is working fine and phone is very good. but adopter not provide with the mobile phone is not good.
I felt like a fool when I found that battery charger cable has not been provided in the order, as per the order . I had an unpleasant talk with your Executive who could  not answer me immediately but later he pointed out so after studying the order. But he could not justify for not highlighting this fact  in the Amazon India App  that one should arrange a battery charger cable on their own, for the Indian customers . I have bought at least 6-7 mobiles of different Brand from Amazon during last 5 years, but I have never found the absence of this accessory. The Executive took my feed back to highlight this fact on Amazon India App itself . I AM impatiently waiting for the type C battery charger cable. Pl be sensitive to different market condition and psyche. Thanks,
Battery life Good
Phone is of good quality. First time trying samsung phone. I hope it won't let me down
Screen is not at par, Ram management is worst out of 8gb internal and 6gb of virtual memory you will 3.2gb free memory, rest 10.8 gb memory Samsung kept it for own usage (sarcastically), price is very high as per the specifications, atleast amoled screen should be provided, overall very bad experience after spending 17k for this.. very very very disappointed, thus thought i should break the usage legacy of my brand Samsung to other good option from S to I and this is the last ph from Samsung brand.
ok
Samsung's budget phones were not that competitive in the budget range people only brought because of brand value and a good customer support but this phone changed that for me it has specification to compete in budget range and gets an edge due to brand value so i bought it. Front camera of 8mp is a disappointing for selfie lover although picture quality is not bad. Processor is better than sd 695 which most other brands are going for in budget range. Screen quality is good but amoled could be there but i guess that increases the price tag so can't complain about screen. Charger not there is not so good but that has to be some business strategy I don't get why. Competition is giving chargers samsung don't. Battery  is a huge plus point no doubt. Overall positives overweigh over negatives for me and I got the phone. No complaints  till now not even minor nuances. Go samsung.


                    The media could not be loaded.


 Fab phone...the display is not ambled but didn't bother me due to quality... it is super fast.  I bought the 8gb version. The look and back is stylish. It is light weight although not very slim from sides.The camera looks good with all the premium features like slo mo, portrait, macro, hyperlapse etc. The performance is super smooth. The new thing is side button finger print sensor. Easy to open. Face recognition is good. Rest will post after using some time. But in this cost, it looks super worth the money. Go for it!Edit:I am surprised why is everyone talking about charger.. we have n number of chargers floating in our houses from older phones and it is a good way of reducing e waste. Also, if they would give the charger and headset, the cost goes high. So may be Samsung can create it as an option for people who want to buy with extra cost. The features of the phones are premium, except Amoled display, but look at the cost.. I think it is a bargain.The phone is fantastic. I have been using since 3 days now, excellent battery backup- 2 days with normal usage (I don't play games), super smooth and fast, and 5g is awesome (use with wifi).Edit:Major audio bug that I am facing in this phone. I requested for a replacement and guess what the replacement phone has that issue too.As soon as I put an audio app to back ground...let's say I am listening a song or an ebook via headphone and I go to home screen, it creates a loud screach and very very loud voice. U will have to take off ur earphone.The biggest issue is the replacement didn't solve this problem. I would have to go to Samsung now. :(Don't buy. Not worth it. I was using M20 for 3 years before this and it was clearly better.
v good produts
Samsung hai toh kya dekhna....it's nice
Nice
Camera Quality should be better. And this is personal you guys can not give charger in the box dudee ut feels so expensive to buy a adapter of 1400 ruppes 🥲
Worth for money with all needs.
I liked the phone expect camera placement and I'm little bit skeptical about it's display. Fully balanced phone and battery backup is best .
Video quality 👌 and dattery quality low charger is problem not provide also
Good mobile phone under 17000/-
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G is the affordable 5G smartphone of the company. Designed for customers who want to purchase a 5G-enabled smartphone.Samsung Galaxy M33 5G sports a 6.6-inch FHD+ display with 1080x2408 pixel resolution. The display offers a 120Hz refresh rate. Samsung Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on top. The display also comes with a water-drop notch which houses the front camera and The screen is not as bright and vibrant as an AMOLED display
Smooth to use with very good performance..
Battery life is very goodCamera is goodPhone looks amazingBig screen
Its 8/128 variant which i got at a very reasonable rate with SBI discount.About phone - decent camera, superb battery, display also I found okay. Overall good phone for people looking in the range of 14 to 16K
Not upto the mark,  also the mobile weight is little heavy in comparison to Redmi mobiles, processor is very fast , interface is as same delayed.Battery backup is also not good as 6000 mah.
I have got this phone delivered 2 days before. But very sad part is that Samsung is not providing charger along with this mobile phone. There are many chargers available and not sure which is the good one. very difficult to decide and again you need to spend around 1000Rs even after paying big amount for the phone. I selected one charger and it says 13 days needed to deliver the charger and no early delivery options even if we are ready to pay extra money. So need to wait for 13 days to start using it .
Without charger Mobile In IndiaThis isn't Possible For Our ANDROID PHONE lovers #SamsungM33 5G  Without Charger In India Boycott This Without Charger from Samsung India
I was using MI A3 which was better than this. Since last three year MIA3 never hang. But this is hanging several times with same app and same load in the mobile. Even with lesser load. Browsing speed is also very slow. Network/connectivity is also very poor on same place.
No warranty card
Very good
Product is good , not bad quality in this priceFor normal user , this is best mobile for this price
Only betry
Good All-rounder but screen is TFT only not even IPS which is disappointing. Amoled is minimum in these price bracket.
It's battery 🔋 is  so awesome.It's camera 📸 is very best after the updation of Android 13.
Nice

Very nice phone. Smooth and no lags. Price is decent
Good phone, works fine, all the qualities of Samsung M33Works on 5G very smoothly
Everything is good ,only with battery
Felt let down since had bought at a higher price which was heavily discounted during sale
Etna mota or bhari mobile hai jaisa lgta hai Jeb m Etta( brick) le kr ghum rhe hai
I got this product in the great Indian sale and got huge discount. It's a decent phone in this price range.
Good choice this segment
charging cabel not working
It's good budget phone...Camera is good..lacks battery life..
Adapter not provided. Image clarity not good.
Good phone at this price
I have used this phone for 10 days. It has started giving me display issues. Even phone gtts hanged for 2-3 second when i search on name in contact list. Since return period is over, I have to visit samsung store as i can't return this. Seems like samsung has compromised on hardware. I was a samsung fan but now have to think twice. My earlier samsung smartphone was A23. Quite good one.
I did extensive research before buying this phone and now that i have it , here are my two cents:Good affordable option for:People who install a lot of appsWatch netflix etc. MostlySurf webTake callsWant long term android update supportFor gamers, I am not sure if they should buy, Antutu scores show Exynos competing with snapdragon processors, but there might be heating issue when gaming for long term.Camera is decent, based on its price segment.Highlight of this phone is it software:OneUI is very smooth, and very stable as compared to oxygenOS etc.Good update support.Samsung PaySamsung Pass (password manager)Secure folder, knox securityCall recording (not working for me presently, but option is given)Cons: Charger is not included. You can buy it at 1100/- (official 25w).Also buy a case, without it you will feel the phone heating and hand might sweat over long use.

Not a huge improvement in performance. I replaced my M30s with this phone. Frankly, except the fact that M30s was giving some problems now, there is not much difference in performance of Both devices, even though they are 3 years apart.Some what disappointing.
Battery is not 6000
People who are buying phone for camera quality , this is not the phone u wanna get.
Battery performance not good &camera also so not good fingerprint only good
Battery life is good . Already lot of reviews present on model won’t drag this one long. Mom happy with it primarily uses it for WhatsApp , video calls, YouTube, regular calls etc . Bought it in offer for around 11-13k post  exchange
Good moblie phone . I used six month after write review. Camera is average , battery good , screen good. A little weight.  And worth of money .
I have given 4 stars because . Box that I recieved seal was broken from one side. And one more thing samsung should have provided the 15watt charger because they are giving Exynos processor means they are saving money so atleast they should have provided charger.Otherwise Samsung phones are best in comparison with mi, realme crap.
The phone specifications is great except the display which is a big letdown.Didn't expect the TFT LCD display to be so bad... Display of Mr six year old phone is better than this one!
The design is sleek.. and the feel is good. It feels good to handle it.The touch is smooth and hassle free.Doesn't lag or heat up.The camera quality is superb.. but the selfie camera disappoints.. its not worth the price.8mp but pictures comes out as if its a 2mp camera.
Charging cable is very poor quality,because charging cable automatically half melted. So can I get replacement the c type charging cable again ? Please help me
Expection ---  as specified tech in declaration of mobile spec.
Meets my expectations in terms of user requirements. Looks good as of now.
BatteryNot bad ,It is around 30% after 19 hours of normal usage,just surfing and social media and installation of apps.Camera.Better than expected from review.Front Camera of 8 MP was supposed to be bad as per review but few selfie in lighted shop have come Good.I am used to 25 MP selfie of Samsung A 50.Internal Storage.128 GB is good storage,But after installing Apps it is showing 33 GB used,Rest of the space will be filled up by Cache and WhatsApp.Edit After 1 week...1. Screen.Sometimes hangs, doesnt respond.2.CameraDay light 8 MP Front camera good,Same thing at home with all lights on gives 2 MP or less feel...
Very nice looks and performance of phone quiet satisfied with it
Good quality
Samsung provide a good phone in this range , its processor, battery life, charging  time is too good, fingerprint  scanner  is so first and good to use,50 mp rear camera is good provide nice photos but it may be little work on camera colors and detailing  .it might  be updated  via software update  hope so.But I am little  disappointed  with the 8mp selfie  camera, its take nice photos in full light,  but in low light  its not provide better selfie and screen flach is medium it also may be correction via update. But if samsung  provided 13 mp selfie camera in this phone its to better.Ovarall the M33 5g phone  is good to use.
Not expect but awesome performance and battery backup and also good price

Very good mobile, but face recognition is not working.
You need to pay extra for travel charger. Very disappointing
Data cable not received.
Everything is nice.l don't have words to speak about this phone.Very nice!!!!
My best phone this is.
All features are good,  but sometimes mobile get heated up also it will slowdown...you need a restart
After exchange it costed 10500.great  battery life and camera quality is good.
Camera quality is good only but not perfectHighly weighted 225gm
good for normal use but this product not for heavy used like camera and performance
tft dispaly but look like ips. good camera and battery. packaging was good but delivery was too slow
Best phone in this price range. Instead of going to Chinese mobile phone. You can go for this.
Quality product at this price. Good packing and safe delivery.
The phone has very good camera and sound.Long lasting battery.Due to sale was able to purchase for 15,000 with exchange of old phone which went smoothly.Only downside is it does not come with charging adapter.It comes with data cable of type C and we have to purchase the charging adaptor separately for about 1400.It also has a port for wired earphones.Overall is a great phone for those with a budget of under 20,000
Only one problem is that it reaches 46 degree on intense gaming. Other than that no issues
Front camera quality is not good...
Screen shot short cut not simple  like  Redmi.
No adapter

sometimes mobile was hanging and mobile update also not received. average camera quality (selfie is better). i am disappointed...
1st Software Update after setup pulls through Android 13 code. 8 GB RAM with hardware + virtual feature is good enough to deliver system required 3GB+ and enough horsepower for other apps. Works well on 5GHz WiFi band. Samsung innovation works well
Overall good
Overall the phone is working good till now and hopefully will continue to work. Camera is fine with many modes which you can choose and click. Speaker quality is stereophonic and good.Overall a good buy and am satisfied
Satisfied with the product
Haning
Nothing great but nothing bad either. Similar to a lot of other 128gb, 8gb phones in the market and sort of ok for the special price of 17.5k, but might not be worth the actual price of a little under 20k.Cons1) heats up during charging and whenever else the phone feels like it2) buying a charger, which is not included, will cost 1.5k more3) camera not at all great4) other than Samsung printed on the back, nothing much in terms of build quality  to differentiate it from competitor( sometimes cheaper )phones with similar spec...Pros1) separate earphone jack which is a must for me2) 2 Sim cards + 1 micro SD slot available3) display is good4) battery charges up quite fast and battery life is as expected
good
Charger should be provided with the mobile package.
SAMSUNG IS SAMSUNG.I LOVE THIS PHONE.
It will be better When it comes along with 25 watt fast charger.
Pros:1. Good quality for below 20k price.2. Battery backup is decent if not heavily used.3.Camera is not bad.4. Fast refresh rate and smoothness.Cons:1. Overheats if used for heavy activity (like gaming).2. A bir on the heavier side.3. Lots of bloatware but u can uninstall them or at worst can atleast be disabled.Overall a decent product  for the average phone user with a not so big budget.
Good Mobile, the audio is not upto the mark,
Fair prise battery 🔋 good
Earlier was using Vivo V9. As compared to that it is a bit heavy. Lot of bloatware as was the case with Vivo V9. Basic Vivo was packed with features which were easy to use and for the same price e.g. screen sharing/mirroring, screenshots, etc. It is a bit complicated in this one may be because of my learning curve. Felt cheated when Samsung provided only chord and had to buy charger separately. It has C type connectors at both ends. So had to but another cable for charging in my car/ with laptop just in case. My earlier mobile screen went blank and had to make a distress buy. I have a grudge against Chinese as I do not know what data they are stealing and hence stayed away from Vivo, Oppo, Motorola, etc. and went for Samsung. I am aware that a lot of things Samsung too gets from China. If you ask me whether one should buy this mobile at 19K price then would say it is a bit high on price for the features it is offering.
Good product
Fine mobile
The phone is excellent. It has great specs and would never lag. Though the screen is a TFT panel it never feels like that. The screen quality is excellent. The main back camera is great. The picture quality is too good. The other three are kinda okay. One thing that is bad is the quality of the front camera. Doesn't work well in low light conditions and has a very low megapixel count.
Camera quality is too bad we can't even compare it's camera with average mi phones canera. As per name samsung is a good brand so it should give good camera in its phone
For people who have used a device with SAMOLED Display before, cannot digest this screen. Eye Comfort Shield (blue light filter) feature turns the black color into brown color. Bluetooth is also not great, intermittent issues are there. Go for M53 or A33 instead.M33 is only for people who want 5g phone in a tight budget.
its a nice product . but it is overpriced according to its features is
Nice Blue colorBudget non Chinese 5G phoneDecent cameraGood battery
It's new generation mobile with 5G . Battery life is good and response time is also quick. Front camera need to improve as it's not same as M33 rest all is gud
Travel adapter not given by company.
Like every thing except its weight.
Charger adopter is not alone with phone.
Good experience
Battery life is awesome.
Some times system UI couldn't respond
Inspite of comparing all other phones finally pick this one with hesitation of display quality and phone weight. Finally both where satisfactory and gave hope that pick was right. Display looks sharp and Vivid u won't find different unless compare with amoled screen, weight management has been very well managed. Yes No charge provided was disappointing. Apart from that felt everything was excellent. Premium fell, solid in hand, call quality, cameras quality was good compare to other brands in this price range, especially samsung one UI with tones of options with adv free experience well done. Definitely this would be the best pick right now compare to all other brand phones if ur looking for future proof many 5g bands and trustable brand with good service support all over the world.
Pros: Good advanced features on UI sectionCons: There was lagging through videos in reels, others apps and not taking number taps in calculator app,

Product is good
Very nice
Overall good
The phone is good for the price. I am using this for past 10 days. I switched from Redmile note series.The key issues I haveA) The app lock feature of redmi is very critical in any modern app and I miss it.B) Not having amoled is a real bad point and it shows in my usage on office choresC) Battery is not great (good not great) considering many apps use location and Bluetooth. I won't blame Samsung but it's 2022 and I was expecting their next-gen batteries.All other functions meet expectation for the category and is reasonable for normal use.

Good mobile , camera is having various options with Good picture quality  , mobile is swift to work in every aspect  , little bit heavyweights,very bad think is that they did not include charger .

 This is 4th Samsung M series phone in my family. Started with two M30S phone for my parents. Then M32s for my wife and now upgrading my fathers phone to M33 5G. Apart from finger print sensor being bit lousy in earlier models no issues at all. Would definitely recommend. Do watch the unboxing video.

NIce goog workingEsay work factionsButter is nice life timeRam is not proper workingLooking nice mobile
Good Product
working flawlessly good product.
Finger print not good  came ok
All good
i purchased it for rs 15999.00. in this price not bad deal. when i update apps then it was heated as like ordinary mobiles then no any cooling system was working as company says. selfie camera not up to mark. i purchase a c to use charging cable and use my old 9v adapter, it take 3 hours time to fully charge. reat of all are good. screen is well, not feel the lack of amoled display. one thing disappointing that when i charge mobile the charging information display not show after screen off. when use dark black wallpaper then screen seems like dark brown instead of dark black, may be due to unavailability of amoled display.
Ok products
After software update mobile working good
Over all the mobile working is good and the weight of the mobile is too heavy and the thickness of the mobile is more  it is not thin when compared to other company mobiles
Everything is good if you expect a phone
Happy with the Phone performance to my expectations. Battery seems to be quite good. Screen resolution, camera and sound are all normal standards and ok if you have low expectations. Not a great phone for taking fantastic pictures. Apps migration was a breeze through Smart Switch app in Samsung. I think you can't ask for a better phone at this price and that too if you get a good discount offer along with it which I got
Speaker 0/5. ... NoisyCamera 3/5... AverageFingerprint 4/5... OkBattery 4/5... OkScreen sensitivity 5/5... Good
A good camera and good battery life this a best phone under 20000.
Travel adaptor is not in the box. You need to buy it separately that cost around 1200 INR approx or under 300 INR if there is any offer.Look and feel: it's good. Love the Mystique green colorCamera: Good quality pics in both daylight and low light in evening and nightPerformance: it's good after using a weekBattery: it can run for a day or more, depends on the usageGame: I have not checked any, but I think it will work fineRecommended but remember no travel adaptor with any samsung mobile... SAMSUNG is trying to earn more money by selling travel adaptor 😂
बैटरी पिकअप अच्छा है सेंसर वगैरा सभी अच्छे हैं कैमरे का क्लेरिटी भी अच्छी है
It's not working properly, sometimes applications are hanging we have to click home button and then re open the application again.No Quality checks from samsung... better to avoid this model

Good product. Nice features of android. Good camera for it's price. Supporting 5G. Long battery life.Charger not available with product.  Need to buy it separately but a genuine samsung charger gives fast charging.Phone does not hang.Good internal storage
Mobile was good
#No adaptor#No headphones#No silicon case#No screen guardWith above items not provided the cost should not go above 12k.Samsung is making a fool of the consumers.
Display quality not good
Good quality mobile at a cheap price.Pros : Its 5G. Battery runs for 2 days if mobile is used in power saving mode & used only for calls with minimum browsing.  Otherwise battery lasts for the whole day even if we use our mobile very frequently. Memory storage has outstanding capacity of 128 GB. Camera is also good. Inbuilt Call recorder is outstanding. There's also Screen recorder function whereby you can record any videos which you see in your mobile on Internet, Youtube etc.Cons: Does not provide Battery adapter. Fingerprint is not that good.
I've been using this Samsung Galaxy M33 5G for a week now, so can put my review basis of this week-Pros:1. Excellent battery life (6000 mAh is indeed a beast). I hardly charged it up thrice during entire week, along with moderate usage. Noteworthy, my mobile data, WiFi and Bluetooth are always on, with Bluetooth headphones.2. Cool camera: I don't know if it's the highest level of mobile camera in this segment or what, but I'm satisfied with the clicks and quality of this device. I'm more of an abstract photographer, especially fond of natural landscapes. My camera does enough justice to me. Even Slow motion and Night Vision modes work just the way they essentially should.3. Premium feel: Touchscreen is I dare say, great. I've used Samsung 8 years back as well, and then I switched to Asus and Motorola. Suffice to say, Samsung is really something else than what it used to be 8 years back, and for good.Cons:1. Travel adapter is missing in this package. I feel Samsung should have added the 25W fast charger adapter along with the device, even for a little extra cost. I've purchased it separately from Samsung store, cost ₹1499/- All in all, it adds to the total cost of the device.2. A few people might find this M33 5G a little too bulky or of a higher weight, at approximately 215 gms. I personally am ok with it, been quite habitual with this weight thing.
Phone charger not given in box
Plastic on the sides is very cheap, small fall is also making visible scars on the body,Better to avoid and choose any other alternative
Nothing extraordinary/ not at all value for money paid .Adopter Charger should have provided along with device since it was difficult to procure original genuine Samsung manufactured Charger, would have been certainly assuring if supplied by Samsung along with device by charging to customers.
Don't buy this it is not good for young,middle age person.Problem faces with routine work.I sell this after two months
It's almost one month now. Overall satisfied with the performance. Camara quality with doc scan is good.  At this price it's a good option.
Power adapter is not available with pack. Need to buy separatelly
Camera quality ko sudhara Jaye to phone bahot achcha hai
The only this bad is the selfie camera at night...Otherwise in morning useage it's goodOtherwise it never disappointed me with 1 Month of useageBack camera is very good and the uhd 30fps & fhd 60fps are awesome as such very goodBattery lasts for longFingerprint is also fastI literally love the 60fps thing in this phoneEven if you use 120hz all day the battery lasts for long
Nice
ok
Delivered on time and it’s in great condition. Using it well and no issues.

Good
I am totally satisfied  with the  battery life it can work for almost 2 days and the fingerprint reader  immediately  work  so that's great 👍
Bluetooth connectivity is not stable, dial pad, got crashed in days after purchase, box don't come with charger
Battery life is awesome, easily lasts for one and half day with normal usage with always connected to internet, camera quality is not up to the mark..good daylight shots though.. display is excellent but not comparable to AMOLED....
smooth and clean UI experience. Decent camera quality. Though saw some reviews complaining about the camera but I haven't noticed as such, it takes great pic even under low light, at night and the front camera is 8MP but it's better than the 20MP camera of some phones. In-hand feel is also good though it weighs heavily (215gm). The display has a TFT panel but produces vibrant colors, no issue with the display, it looks the same as AMOLED until not viewed from side angleCons- expected AMOLED display, heating issues while charging, expected much slower battery drainage as it has a 6000mAh battery, adapter not given
We perchaged this phone for camera. But we feel dispoint after using the phone.
Very nice product nice camra
On a high-level overall it is good. Once we start using the mobile we can write a review. For now i can say charger should be provided separately. Only USB cable is available. How come a mobile without charger is given. Do a customer need to purchase charger separately?Thanks
Worth the Cost
Great purchase for android preferrers and price effective product.
Good  prize 5g phone
This is worse than M51. I thought it would be an upgrade. Lot of bugs make it seem like this phone has not been tested fully. When any Bluetooth device (smart watch) is connected any call goes on speaker of watch by default. I took it once to service centre but this phone has so many issues I can't take it to service centre for small small bugs. My faith had shaken on Samsung products.

 Bhout bahidea mobile 📲 hi 17500 prige
Samsung charjar west...Charjing time ovar
For this price they could hv given amoled display. Display is the major drawback. Its like 5000 rps display. Very cheap. Network issues. No stability. Heating issues. Battery discharges quickly compared to other samsung mobiles. Only 6hrs battery when screen on. A day in screen off condition. Go for Infinix or Realme or Moto. Very much disappointed with LCD display and battery
Loved the color and looks of the phone. The charger is not provided which can cost u extra money. I missed reading about the contents in the box.Rest all features are good. Samsung is as usuall having nice hardware and good operating structure. All 6 mobiles in my home are samsung only.Should have provided with the charger to be more worthy at the price. 16999 is the price which was worth buying, camera quality is also better. Battery life is very good.
Battery backup is not good as your given details by your aap.
No ChargerAverage charging timeOld Design pattern and lookNo Network speed indicatorNo IR blaster but other brands have of same segment or cost.
Voice not clear during call
I liked this smartphone overall performance. The camera is up to the mark, battery backup is awesome.....stays 1 and half day with hard use. Sound quality is good. Doesnt heat..  Display could be better.... RAM is enough.Recommended to all.
Nice phone sound also goodCharger not given its default
Few things I have noticed since the time I am using this phone.  When I leave my phone screen faced down,  2 gears appears on the screen and stays for an ample amount of time.  Iwant to understand if it's normal! I have also experienced slowness, frozen screen alongside with screen fluctuations while using an app., like it was trying to open a new window then close consecutively. If there's something I can do about all this,  I want to know!
Thanks Amazon for giving best deal on this product. M33 is good quality built phone and want to order one more. Waiting for Amazon offer to buy in same deal.
After using 48 hours:1. Battery life- good,  worked for whole day.2. Wi-Fi range quality 👌.3. LCD response good 👍.4. SIM network (In my city 4G ) good 👍.5. Voice clarity good 👍.6. Amazon delivered it safely 🙏.
I was a Motorola user since years. Since I got this phone, was a fan of thus affordable stable Android 5G phone. Impressed with it's features, stability and build quality. Camera quality was good. At pat when compared with other mid range phone models. Hesitated to buy this earlier, but after buying and using it, felt satisfied. Battery lasts long even after using OTT apps like Hotstar etc. No charger is the only disappoint but rest all good with thus phone.
Good product. The performance of the handset is so far so good. Sure to buy
I am using a Samsung M33 as well and facing issues with the lock screen which does not wake up upon receiving a notification.  Why is such a basic feature like Screen Waking up upon Notification is not working for this phone and also many other buyers are facing the same issue..Moreover, if Samsung is aware of this issue why are you not working on fixing this issue with a Software Update. How can a phone which is priced for almost 20K does not have such a basic feature that a 10K Android phone provide.Absolutely disgusted with this purchase and this is how you lose a customer forever. Rest assured this will be my last Samsung mobile ever. I will also ensure that no acquaintance of mine ever gets my recommendation to buy a Samsung phone. Pathetic !
Perfectly as described!
I haven't used any heavy apps like games or such. Based on my general use, I would say this phone is a great quality phone with all essential as well as extra features. The battery life is a bit short especially if you continuously use it(one day would be the maximum with extended use). Selfie camera is good but the rear cam isn't that good when using it at extended zoom. Other than that it is a good quality all rounder phone after taking into consideration that I got it at more than 40% off.
Never expected this rubbish thing in this price that how Samsung can stop delivering charger with mobile... Rubbish
Good device with a good processor.Battery life is no doubt a key feature of this device.Performance is also good, but there are better choices available in this price if you ok with those OS with multiple advertiand blotware.Camera is kind of ok, but personally I don't like it. So much noice in image.Don't forget there is no travel adapter in the box which cost me ₹1,249 from Samsung website.Rest choice is your, but if you are going for this device then I don't think you need to change for next 4-5 year's unless you want to.
Front camera is very pathetic, cant expect such a poor performance
No issue  to found while  ordering plan
It is only for genral work not for specially camera or gaming,not perform face unlock accurate.
Battery is very poor,  getting discharged soon and takes lot of time to recharge back.
I am reviewing this after a week used. The battery is like 4000mah, front camera is like vga (not good at all) other than all performance is good
i will not get changing adaptor of samsung mobile so please give me charging adaptor

 Camera quality is poor
Good battery backup, processor and Camera. only one drawback is High weight.
Phn acha hai but adapter nhi mila sath mai uske liye mujhe alg se 900 kharch krne pare otherwise thik h
Good phone
Phone is ok except camera is not that great as expected. Also Please check samsung site before purchasing, this product is at lesser price available on prime sale day. This is not expected from Amazon. The exchange value given is more and top of it Samsung website provides adapter also worth 1400 for only 299.
Battery backup thoda kam hai fingerprint Achcha hai
Don't expect much more from this product, Battery drains problem, Heating problem after using single App. Buy this phone due to 6000 MAH battery but it's just okok. Rest Design body perfect.
6000mAh Battery not giving enough backup. Need to recharge before 24 hours.  In last 2 days I charged it 3 times. Really worrying factor. I feel need to return the product.
Worth well
I have purchased this phone 1 month ago.ProsTouch is fastFinger print sensor is fast.Processing power is good. Better that exynos 9611.NFC is there which is not even in M53.Battery is 6000 mah.5g connection.ConsNo Amoled , screen is barely visible in sun light.Battery backup is not upto the 6000 mah mark.My m31s was able to give me better screen on time.Camera is average , M31s far better camera than this.
very good phone
I like the overall performance of the phone, but the only issue with it is over heating even if you use single app for more than 10 minutes. It is really annoying when your hand is getting over heated in the summer. I constantly have to close all background apps and open apps and leave it indeed for 10-15 minutes to cool it down. The other think in the phone are mostly good and average.
Cellphone is really okay, but what the heck with the USB cable... It has two type-c charging plug 🔌, my question is where do i plug in these...
Good
Excellent
This phone is a big improvement over M32.Never faced any lag or heating issues.Smooth perfomance for everyday tasks.Big battery, so I don't have to think often to charge it.I don't play games on mobile so can't say about that.Android 12 with OneUI 4.1 is a big plus.For ₹16,500, this phone worths to get considered.Cons: Buying the charger separately is really a turn down. Samsung offer of getting charger in ₹300 could have been on amazon too.
It is very useful one. Camera quality is average. Designed one. Screen quality is normal. Sound is OK.
I',m an average user, camera,fingerprint sensor, processor, voice focus,display and 120 hz refresh rate, etc. Are all things are good but all of this you might catch some minor problems. If we ignore this, then definitely go for this Intelligent Smartphone. Last but not the least battery life is not so good its just okay but this smartphone comes near about 18,000 that is pretty much higher than others.
Nice phone🤙🤙👍👍
Samsung always good product exactly galaxym33 5g very good product yesterday received the phone nice one that happened is must they should produce charger otherwise nothing
It hangs a lot
Battery is over heating on playing videos
Phone hangs intermittently 😡
Fantastic FP reader & camera quality. Battery life is also good but if would be more better. Overall value for money.
Good product .
Ok
Back feels so slippy and phone feels quite weight. Also battery drains faster and too much background tests runs even at idle
Little bit costly phone and adapter should be purchased separately is not good please include charger with phone.
While it doesn't have Amoled or UFS 2.1 the TFT makes up with better sunlight legibility. The biggest sore point was the lack of charger. Got only USB C to USB C cable which is pretty much useless for connecting older PC and laptops which don't have USB C. And the charger 25W costed a bomb. That's terrible from Samsung. My dad has M31 which was latest at that time with better camera better screen and better storage with charger and USB C to USB B at less price than this.
Good phone, battery life also good. Why it is new trend of not giving charger with new mobile purchase. If a person spending 18K for new mobile and charger not included and shown discount of 5/6K is not good strategy. I have fear that in future, there will not be even mobile in the package. headphone already removed long back. Why changing the strategy, cost cutting or anything else?
This is the most value for money 5G smartphone from samsung. After doing a lot of research i finally settled for M33 5G.The display is brilliant, camera superb and performance outstanding also comes with Android 12 and OneUi4 out of the box. Battery life is like i get 3 days on normal usage and 2 days on heavy usage.This is a major update over M32.I dont think no other phone in this price segment can beat M33 5G.
Battry Backup is very low in 6000mah,  also hanging problem, not found too much good. .
The cable was working correctly but suddenly stopped charging the mobile although the mobile can get a charge from another cable and the charger is also charging another mobile. what is it Samsung another type A to type C cable is charging the mobile properly? Still, the original charger is not supporting the mobile phone, mobile also gets heated sometimes this was not expected with this model at a decent range mobile phone. but the type c to type c is not working properly
I have to samsang mobile 1isF232 is M33... F23 performance is smooth much better then m33M33 is bakwas very slow performance
Great phone
i am using this phone since 2 days...earlier i used motorola g5 plus .good things of this isdisplay is tft but better than other company mobilehardware is good. after continue using 2 hrs  it  is not hitting....rear camera is good.but in zoom or big screen some picture are blurfront camera is not good.  8mp is not sufficient...why i choose this phonemy preferance was good hardware and battery life...convincing use in day to day ..camera is not my priority128 gb and 6gb ram
Good
Ok
Camera is cheap quality.. i am using this phone for daily normal operation. Not upto the mark.
Its an excellent phone with high battery life which lasts more than 24hours if normally used..
Bought with an exchange offer. Exchange process is very clear and no issues. M33 is working fine. Performance and battery backup are best. One charging is sufficient for 48 hours Quad Camera has good features.
I have been using this for almost a month now hence in a good position to review.Its a good phone below 20K.Processor and Surfing is good.Camera is good but not the best in class.Battery is best in class.8GB+128GB gives ample space with speed to browse throughtout.Its a bit bullky.Look and feel is awesome.Just a few wifi issues with watsapp connectivity.Overall 4 star for this cell phone.If you are looking for smartphone below 20 K you can go for this.
Fantastic battery Services & Features.But main issues on this phone .Complaint of problem in mobile: (1) No voice is hearing from other side and no voice hearing on other side on mobile during communications from last one week. (2) If power off and start again, then communications done for few time of duration and same problem happened. Please solve this matter otherwise im return this mobile.
Been using it for a week.Battery life is very good.My expectation with the camera of the phone was very low but it is good.The only drawback of the phone is it is a little heavy compared to other phones.It could be bcs of the 6000Mah battery.I donot play any game so the review is according to that.
Overall is OK.But when received invoice IMEI not Mentioned.
Camera is similar to previous versions if samsung like m13 with screen inches and battery life gives good performance if i charge 2hrs it getting whole day almost without again to charge
Camera is good.  Battery is not fully satisfied.
Good but it's kinda heavy than M53 and resolution not like M53 okay for Mom.
Primium look with high battery backup.1 hour to full charge from 10 to 100 % when using 25 w charger.Camera is average with good colour tone capture.Brightness is Normal than normal  TFT display. Not feel display is TFT.Support 2.5 , 5 GHz WiFi .Processor Speed is good for Normal users mail , camera , browsing and gaming too.It's a good and primium look Phone From samsung m series.Highlight features are battery and Android OS 12 .Knox security is an advantage .
Been using Apple for the past 10 years and this is my first attempt on Android . Found it amazingly good. The screen resolution is top class with crystal clear screen, and watching videos is a pleasure and no strain on the eyes. Battery life us amazing. Made a good decision to buy Samsung fir my second number. Next time will go for a higher model in Samsung itself. Time to shift from Apple !!
The camera quality is just amazing and so is the smootness in this phone because of 8gb ram. The high screen fresh rate is also a good feature about this phone. So far, i haven't faced any problem with this version as i did in such medium price ranged phones of samsung
Received my phone before 3 Weeks. I wouldn't suggest to go for it.. not worth it at all.Cons.1. Poor Camera Quality2. Poor Video Display Quality3. Very Heavy in weight4.One drawback also is no charger included in the box.Camera and Video are the first features. Selfie Camera pics looks like a old VGA Camera.. reminds me the Quality of old small feature phone. Video Quality on even youtube is vert bad.Was having high hopes from Samsung but disappointed badly.
Getting difficulty in talking screen shot
Battery is worst
3 finger Screen shot not take, and music player application not working continuous songs play
There are many folks who compare this mobile to the 1k cheaper model F23 5G and say this is overpriced. But this model has 1000mah more battery capacity whose advantage will become obvious only when we actually starts using 5G networks. We all know how faster the battery drains when we switch from 3G to 4G itself. Other than that everythings runs fine on this mobile, no lags or heating issue and the camera is Ok. 4 camera setup design reminds of some iphone models.
👎
It looks like 16MP camera inside a 50MP camera. Picture quality is not good. No video stabilizer, pixel density is not adequate as it is 50MP. I am somehow dissatisfied about the Camera performance. Screen would be AMOLED but given LCD.No doubt, it has premium looks, smooth and fast operations, good sound, long battery, and affordable.
Average product..Battery is good..camera is average
Its a great phone, no doubt has many features that you wouldn't see in Chinese phones.Major drawback is Adapter not provided, yeah that's killing it.Otherwise everything is good, it has good camera quality, yeah even the front camera (8mp) takes great selfies that you wouldn't see in redmi phones that may have higher pixels.I was fed up Chinese phones (specially Redmi) that's why I chose this phone, yeah I knew it's not providing charger but Type C to C cable is great.
ok
I use the og charger yet when I plug the phone gets hot. It's not very hot but noticeable.  When I play a song with my earpods it's the same.Idk if it's just me or a common issue but I will check at the service centre one. The finger print reader fails you register prints, and with wet fingers it is a pain. The phone screen also gets affected by things like wires of a headphone, which is annoying sometimes but fine. Overall it's a decent phone, but I expected more. At least the thermals.
Except a great battery,  everything is common
Camera could have been better. But display provided is a huge turn off. For both these reasons, it is not worth the money. Other functions and features are good. Can go for it if you don't want to shell money to Chinese brands.
The mobile dosent come with adapter, the charging cable is C type from both the sides so we need a adapter which is a C type adapter. But it's not coming with mobile.
Battery is Over hitting while charging the phone....& That's why it's really useless thing which I really don't like
First of I beg your pardon for my comments because I am not so savvy user. A middle-aged non-gamer. So for me it very well serves my purpose. And that's also from all perspectives I look at it; to be precise the camera, storage, battery and the likes. Only performance is something which I am not very sure of as of now i.e. after using for 1 month 10+ days. Need to experience before commenting further.
Good.
If you are thinking to buy phone in this budget then this is the best choice for you. Phone is more amazing than my expectations. All the features which they mentioned really work well. Touch is really very fast by its 120Hz Refresh Rate. Camera quality, Sound quality, Fingerprint reader & Battery life all is great. Must buy product.
Camera and battery are very good.One problem: While using Google maps if you get any incoming call, the phone goes into some unknown problem state. Later, only restart has worked. Also the keypad is little irritating. Expecting fix for the issues
I would like this phone for better performance,  good battery life , but please note camera quality is average only and not upto the mark as we expect  from  Samsung phones
Good product
This phone doesn't have options to take screenshot otherthan pressing lock and vol down keys. The palm swipe option is not available. I even called samsung support regarding this and they said it'll be added in the next update but they did not.We can add only 3 finger prints. Camera quality is really poor. Battery backup is okay but not as expected.
It's a really good phone but front camara is little off & samsung can provide a better quality display & It's brightness It's enough for indore situation but in outside it can make visibility issue some time specifically in harsh light ,last but not the list adopter , except this problems the phone is working absolutely fine , battery backup is best in its bracket & back camara working nice , & ONE UI 4 JUST AMAZING totally worth its price
Loved colour, look and all functions in it 👌🤘😎
Camera is good. However taking pics is slow. Gaming on this mobile is slower. Rest all fine
Samsung galaxy m33 is best buy product
Switched from iphone XR to this phone few weeks ago. Performance has been decent.  Camera and picture quality is sub par compared to iphone, face recognition is super flop. Battery back up is good. Bought a Mi 20w fast charger at 600 bucks and it charges super fast
The phone  is good but adopter and headphone is not given
There's no earphone in the box. Phone is a bit slow.
M31 had motherboard issue, so little anxious about this issue this time.M33 5g downside.1. Poor software designWhen you change orientation of phone or switch app while eye shield is on, there is blink like inconsistency found. This phone gets time to active eye shield on changing orientation.2. No amoled, no AOD. Samsung is toooo greedy.3. Some apps don't run on full screen4. Game launcher has no common feature as was found in previous version. (While blocking all notifications, there is no option to allow calls. So, either you have to allow everything or nothing at all).5. Sometimes bit slower6. Files app is poorly designed where no option to select view under grid view. (There is four file grid and it's fixed. Much better if it allows to view three or five files in grid view, as we can do it in gallery app).M33 5g upside1. Best brand and trustworthy2. Camera and skin is looking good3. Settings page much organized4. 120Hz screen awesome.5. Many bloatwares are deletable (thank god).6. Fingerprint sensor real fast.
Some time hanging experience for few seconds
Got the device arround 14K, its good deal. Not recommended for gaming. Bit bulky and have some weight.
I have another model of Samsung with 6000mh battery. Compare to that M33 battery is draining fast as compared to another.
Overall good experience, battery life, looking wise, both sim and SD card can insert in same time. But should also available adapter and earphone as well this is seems cost cutting now these days.
Phone is Made in INDIA so,Battery Drains very fast even it is 6000 mah ...My Motorola phone battery is superior than this samsung M33
All three Quality Best & Awesome...👍
Camera& battery


                    The media could not be loaded.


 day 1- packaging was really bad, no bubble wraps nothing but the phone is thankfully okay.Camera is alright and the screen is good too, doesn't look like cheap tft displays. Turned off 120 hz because that was laggy, samsung shouldn't put that in lcd only works well on amoleds. Anyways, overall a good phone.I know there are better options in this price range obviously but I'd rather not buy chinese products so only good choices left are samsung or apple and apple doesn't the most affordable tech out there.
Camera battery 🔋 color ram ...best
The audio is missing at times during calls.
only cons: little bulky due to high mAh battery. I never wanted to go for Chinese phone so opt for this.Overall : 4/5
I used this for photos and general use
Affordable mobile with amazing features.
Best in this price range
Samsung M33 5G is one of the phones under ₹₹15k with almost all top features and has 5G which makes your future ready and need to buy a new one once 5G is rolled out in India. I got a bank discount of ₹3k. Improvement needed in the fingerlock sensor and Front Camera which is not on par with it's predecessor M32.
Real User Review for "Genuine Buyer" looking for good smartphone -It's a great handset for anyone looking for good smartphone on a budget. (for 9ffice professionals and regular/normal users)Pros:- Robust build quality (as always maintained by samsung)- Good hardware specifications- Nice display (being a super amoled display user of my S20 FE, display of m33 is very close to that - very smooth and bright)- Samsung Software (so more secured and 4 years OS support)- Decent camera quality- Great battery life (6000 mah)Cons:- many complained of missing charger - but since this handset is having 6000 mah battery, so it makes complete sense to invest on 25 watts samsung charger as it will charge this big sized battery pretty fast. And type-c cable is already given in the box, so will have to buy only charger.(Anyway charging these new handsets with 15 watts charger takes lot of time)Verdict for a genuine buyer looking for real user review - Do not get mis-guided by false bad reviews.It's a great phone for the price point its available at and it's Samsung (so more reliable and secured) on software security)
Facing an issue of automatic restart which is not even resolved after many updates
Very nice and cheap mobile, I found this battery also last longI found a better option from amazon for which i want to thank you.
Every thing is good, but the video on this Tft is terrible, even at 720p the video looks like running on 144p,
Battery is good
Heavy phone
The phone is ok . And The performance  is so good it is price is 18k  i am buy on sale and i exchange my old phone at a good price and its me ony 10k price after the discount and exchange. Overall is good but charger is not provided  with this . But one of the issue  is phone is so heavy .
Alla good but my charging port is not working and I want to warranty clame how can I do this please guide
Currently on day 1 and here's what I feel:Pros:1. battery battery battery... given a SOT of around 9hrs and at 25%.2. Good quality screen don't get upset by TFT.3. Bluetooth output is good.4. Fingerprint sensor is snappy.Cons:1. It's big and heavy so your pockets are gonna feel it.2. Dated design.3. Doesn't support dual 5g but there's dual 4g.Still exploring it.... will share my experience after a month.UPDATE:it's just irritatingly laggy
Ok
There are many great features in this i am explaining few of them-1 Great battery2 Battery efficient 5nm processer and one of the fastest processer in this price range.3 The display of this phone is good, my opinion-better than IPS display4 One of the best rear camara in this price range5 Best software experienceSamsung phones are best.
Nice pic 👍
Ram speed is slow
The cable given for this mobile is C to C. So we need to buy an adapter separately. I thought I can use my old mobile adapter but it's not possible, so I bought a Samsung adapter.
Looking good

 The phone is best in its class. The performance of this phone is fantastic as it comes under 5nm architecture. Also the battery life of this phone gives 2 days battery backup. The Camera Quality is also very good. The Android version is 12 and Samsung provides update of next two OS updates and 4 year security patches are also provided by Samsung. With all such benefits this phone becomes the most aggressive in this price segment. The Working on this phone is also very much fast and provides fluid experience. Anyone who wants to buy the phone under 15k to 20k can go with this. Also with its 25W charger the phone get charged in less than 2 hours. The battery is also bigger in this phone and comes with 6000mah. So this makes this phone pretty powerful and long lasting. Also it supports 12 5G Bands. So definitely go with this M33 5G phone.
Good phone for Budget
Excellent
Ther is lot of room for improvement. It same old plastic build which is not strong, atvthis price range samsung should gone for amoled, Display isn't producing perfect color, phone is have a lot of bolt ware, some time's bolt ware install automatically without our control , we need to be careful while accepting terms or we will be end with many unwanted apps.
Decent phone. Big screen, place for micro SD card, additional app management and notification features are welcome. Let me talk on common complaints. Heating is only on heavy use otherwise quite OK. Cable both ends C type is an issue but it will be future. Hence have an adapter. Or use old cables with C type to USB2. New laptops comes with C type ports nowadays. Lots of apps from Samsung which are forced to have.
Phone is very good in budget but facing some of issue for quick response in performance with the phone, plan to raise the observation with Samsung if they can improve by doing some corrective actions. Not feeling awesome in terms of performance of phone. Phone is not instantaneous responsive as soon as lock open or doing screen lock by pressing finger lock or pin code, take time in response as having 6GB RAM with 120Hz refresh rate.
Charging cable pins are same at both ends, unable to charge.
Finger print reader on the power button frequently unlocks when holding the mobile without our knowledge.Exceptional camera picture and video quality.Battery charging is very fast and battery charge lasts longer than expected.
My order M33 mobile 5G, i didn't receive USB Deta Cable.
Performance is good, amazing battery life
Pros: perfect combo of specs within this budget and of course the offer I have availed from Amazon* CAMERA: Owesome* Performance and battery: highly satisfiedCons: phone is really weighty and width is also little problematic
Amazing Phone. Have all the top features. I love the camera and the whole Interface. Recommended.
I am Samsung handset user for very long time.I am very happy and satisfied with their products. In fact I gifted Samsung to my wife and daughter also who was earlier using OPPO.


                    The media could not be loaded.


 I have not received the charger adapter. Only USB cable has been received. Plz suggest me
Product is good but company not giving charger.  why we have to purchase separate charger if mobile cost is more than 17000rs next time I'll go for another brand which provides charger in same price.
Battery life to worst. i installed more than 20 app for daily life use. after that backup only alive 24hrs. it is too low. Camera to bad. But performance is super after installed 20 apps. Some time 1st sim shot sim not working properly. Out of this very nice mobile
Good phone,only drawbacks are weight and fingerprint scanner
It has 8 GB Ram so it won't hang and sufficient internal storage. The rear camera is good but the selfie camera is not upto the mark. More or less I loved this.
Camara not Good, highly disappointed. Some time finger print also not respond properly.
Gets heat up quickly and the back of the phone got corroded even after using back cover. Camera quality is fine but not so good.
Without charger plan is worstYou take extra 1000 but you have to add charger including mobile in boxI am not satisfied in this case
Likethe product second time good quality control.SVSubbaRao
Battery performance is upto the mark. Can handle heavy workload and lasts for a day sure. Photography to some extent ok. What's very disappointing-phone is lagging and takes time to switch over to other apps in multitasking which is very much irritating. Otherwise phone is good in all respect. And finally the price- Felt cheated . High price for this type of TFT display.
Please see screenshots.Storage: Storage speed test in Antutu seems to get score of 28000. When I asked customer chat in Samsung portal, they said it is EMMC 5.1.Battery: is 5830 mAh, not exactly 6000 mAh. Better not to cheat customers by marketing a 5830 mAh battery as 6000 mAh. Instead, give an actual 6000 mAh battery.Display: seems okay, but has some dark borders at all edges of display. Borders are thicker than other phones.Camera: at low light does not identify objects well.Overall, Samsung should work on giving more value at same price by providing either UFS 2.1/3.1 storage or amoled display.Battery life: doesn't come 2 days with moderate usage. Exynos processors need to efficient not only in terms of nanometers, but also in software-hardware optimization, which seems to be lacking.Will add updates if I find any after few weeks.Edit on 23 April 2022: Light sensor is not working correctly and quickly, and proximity sensor is working very slowly. Display is not visible under sunlight.Edit on 2 May 2022: Added more screenshots. Light sensor is not identified. One of the apps shows EMMC 5.1 as storage type. Feeling my money got wasted.Edit on 13 May 2022: Touch response and phone response both are slow due to EMMC 5.1 storage. At least they could have given UFS 2.1 for INR 15,999. Both 50 MP and front 8 MP cameras have the worst clarity and quality. Please refrain from buying this device. Too many compromises are done in this phone.Edit on 20 May 2022: There have been many fake reviews seen, probably to improve the rating and feedback. Do a comprehensive and deep research before deciding to buy. This phone is not at all recommended with the worst hardware configuration - No charger, worst cameras and proximity, light sensors.
Overall M33 is definetely a hit with its features apt for a user.
But good product
Im writting this review after using it more than 2 weeks. Battery stays for a longer time.But no adpater had been provided along with this pack.Bought it for 15999rs after discount .Camera ,overall performance is good.camera night mode as usual blur .Fingerprint in the power button not so comfortable .Adapter can be given for this price.On search app ,it takes much time to find it out.Screen brightness at very low level too its been brighter.
I loved the product but only one drawback. They didn't provide adaptor with the cable keeping the excuse of saving environment ahead.
Completely satisfied with performance, ui and design.
Overall good performance
Sometimes some apps can't open. Apps blinks and closed. Even when I want to delete photos they blink like tubelight.
Not most liked
Only thing I miss, is the charger which a buyer needs to purchase seperately
Got 8gb ram/128gb variant for 12849/- with exchange . Overall very good phone with all the features you need for. Even though it’s lcd display ,u will never feel like display is bad compared to ambled etc, don’t watch too much tech review before buying because no need of in depth tech information , even though the mobile has many inbuilt apps, u can delete whichever u don’t need and with all settings , the phone is one BEAST😀
Camera quality is best...battery life upto 48hours.every feature is good enough...only the problem I couldn't solve is the alarm setting.it doesn't work while power off.
Good battery life!
Nys phone its working good but camera quality is not that much appreciatable
I bought Samsung M53 5G 8GB from Amazon. Before buying I read some of the customers reviews which were positive and some negative. But after buying I found the handset as one of the best in the offer price range of Rs.22000/- only.
battery is goodcamera is oklooks is bad
Not bad not so good
Samsung Galaxy M33 5Galmost a week completed after start using my new mobilePros :Happy with performanceHappy with quick chargingCons :Camera is not so good for this price not sure if its my config issueonly charger cable provided in box [ Type-C to Type-C cable ]No charger provided in boxType-C to Type-C charger power adaptor is also costly to purchase
Battery performance is not adequate. It came down 35% when the Phone is not in usage ( standby time). Not sure whether they have mentioned the battery Life time when in usage and not in usage anywhere in the product description. Other mobiles usually gives upto 3 days as per previous Mobile usage experience
The product came without any charger as mentioned in the packing slip. The package quality was not good. The handset being heated while charging. Not so good product compared to the money paid. Better to go for Redmi Note 10 pro instead of this which is too costly as the brand name of Samsung.Dr N B Shridhar
Samsung M33 is a good and affordable product for middle class users. Looking good and attractive .According to cost wise it's camara quality is also satisfactory.Someone can buy their use and gift to their near and dear.
Can't comment on the product as it is only few  days, but it hanged a few times for sure. Samsung Company should also put screen protector to your mobile please. Also either charger should have been provided or some discount coupon should have been provided to buy samsung 25w charger.Re Delivery - on time delivery but a major issue on delivery style. Your person don't call, don't ring the bell, just put the package in front of the door and leave. If I did not see the delivery notification,  I would not be even aware of it. Even someone could have took it away from outside of my door if I did not picked.Amazon please improve your delivery style. In my apartment there has been a significant increase in the wrong deliveries by Amazon daily.
Good quality of camera, battery is good
Really nice phone and i purchased it in 11499 using exchange and card disc during amazon sale.Though delivery boy has asked for 100 rs more for exchange which was already paid at the rime of booking and he was jnsisting me to pay and he refused to give me phone.Rest nice phone and happy about it
While using the device become heated within a very short period.
Handset was goodBut not providing charger
Camera quality is Cheap but other thing are best
Auto brightness is not that much efficient
Very good mobile with best quality camera and battery life. Its' value for money for a 5G phone.
Everything works fine but has a drop notch display and a 2 mp macro and telephoto camera which captures pixelated photos . Pros :For a 5g phone it is a better option.It's 6000 mah battery is good to use for 1.5 day.Android 12 and one ui 4.1 keeps us updated.
Dise like
Mobile ok..... No accelerices given....
Data cable got faulty within 6 months.
Camera Best in class
Everything is fine ,Phone is more thick and weight as compared to other Phones and premium phones .
Sound system to be better.
Very good phone


                    The media could not be loaded.


 I have received wrong USB cable and I am unable to charge mobile phone
Finger not touch by fone. Waste. Samsung hate. boikot.
As mentioned in the title keeping the charging adapter tempered and back cover aside the mobile is amazing and also it is not that heavy.Also I got it for 16k and adding the 1149 for the fast charger. Because charging adapter is important Only thing which I did not like about this mobile is the front camera and it does not support 4k videos on YouTube. Rest everything is good.
I like this एम३३ mobile very much.Best one in this range.
Best phone in resonable price
The mobile phone is advertised in the app is with sim card ejector pin, c type USB cable but actually the box comes alone with one piece mobile handset only. Too much rediculous marketing.
Great purchase. Been using it for a week now and overall it's a complete value of money.  Hope it stays that way in the long run as well
Amazing phone with good features. Only thing which is lacking is the charging adapter.
Good product
Like all things in this phone phone is suberb but want some software improvement by update........
Awesome
Pros:  Battery charge within 30 mins  Lasts for about 2 days at average use.  Very fast on all applications.Cons:  Finger print is on power button so can't able to hold my phone.  Camera quality is average  Lot of unwanted app come with this phone.
Anil
I really like the product ,  UI and performance as well .Have to see in future how it works with 5G , camera quality is not too great but it is okay in good lighting .I am bit disappointed as charger cable is provided without adapter that has to be separately purchased with 550/- rs and no ear phones too in box
1. The finger print and power button are one. Hence the sensor is it hardly reading it otherwise go for pattern lock or pin or password.2. There is no charging adapters in box. So you have to purchase it separately from service center with a cost of Rs. 1699/-. So the total price of handset is 17,999+1699= 19,698.
Display is ok.Fingerprint reader is placed at wrong place. Sometime found it unlocked while picking it from pocket.
Charger should be included with box
power button is not working correctly when turning on screen
First thing phone weight is high than other phones in the segment. Battery backup is not upto 6000 mAH. Camera pixel is like 10 MP not upto the 50 MP.When it comes to processer samsung used 6 cortex A55 cores and  2 A 78 cores which is not expected from samsung.
Liked the product. Good performance.
This phone is really good.  Its camera quality is good.  Its processor is very good.I would urge everyone to buy this phone.  If you want a good phone at a low price
Nice Product
I used this phone last one month... Good phone of this budjet.. Screen mirroring working perfectly. Battery back up good.. No lagging to open the app... No heating issue.. Camera quality& finger print reader are not bad. Sound quality is good. Fast charging.No charger with this this phone... Only that is the disadvantage.
Nice performance..Battery Good.Came not bad..
Samsung is giving very nice quality and features even in affordable range,M33 is my again great phone from M series.Tuff body and glass, great battery life, easy touch and much more. I had purchased M33 due to my last experience of M31s and that is also superb.
I've ordered such an expensive phone ,got the phone but not received charger and headphones.😡 only a USB port is available in the delivery box.What is this playing with customers trust.We pay full amount then also we don't receive full item. How a phone can work without a charger.This is truly disappointing.
For casual daily use
Camera quality is not good
The design and color of the phone is stunning and the battery performance is good with overall screen interaction. Just the weight of the phone could have been a little lighter as other series of samsung phone.
The battery back up is good and charging is also good, only the camera needs to be upgraded
I used the phone pash 1 month... neat performance.... so far no issues... one major con  is its weight.. feel so heavy on ur hand
Itne kam price me itna aacha phone koi mil hi nahi sakta.... very nice phone
Mobile is good enough in that price range. The disapointing thing is they are not giving charger with budget phone. Any way phone is good if yoy are normal user.
Price was under my budget

Mobile is good, buy this phone I have  credit card use and payment convert to EMI, but amazon card extra charge every month, so please be carefull 🙏
May be i didn't read properly, adapter for charing is not included in the package, have to buy separately...
The best phone money can buy for business use.
This is the best phone at this price range. My old Lenovo phone was dying and I wanted a new phone exclusively for my office work, with some excellent camera and some light gaming. This was perfect choice.Pros :1. Huge battery with an option to protect it from over charging.2. Automatic updater and app killer.3. Excellent picture and sound quality.4. Camera is just outstanding. Can take pictures even without proper light.5. Facial and fingerprint recognition are excellent.6. Processor is top notch, in competition with Snapdragon with good mqximized returns.Cons :1. Comes installed with a lot of Samsung Bloatware apps that I don't want and not needed.2. Doesn't be have proper screen guards or case covers in the market yet. Hopefully will change in the future.3. Though RAM was 8GB almost half of it was always occupied. I don't think that much RAM is neede for caching though.
Your can purchase it. No issue still detected.
You will get a great software experience, clean UI and a secure device with no lag or jitters. Display is as per expectations not good or bad, signal reception is good, carrier aggregation works nice, call quality is good and battery performance is better than the competition. You can play light games , for serious gaming search something else. They should have included the adaptor in a budget device!
Battery life poor
Surprisingly battery is not that good. Had high expectation considering it's 6000 mah. Maybe specs are and features are too heavy.Otherwise every other features are smooth as butter.
I loved this phone. camera quality is awesome, slightly heating while charging otherwise no issue......i used this phone whole day and battery is still 23%. but had to purchase travel adapter separately as mentioned in the product. it looks awesome ....... so no complaints.
Need to improve in many areas
Writing this review after using this for almost a month. Being a user of samsung products for almost a decade, which is very reliable and offers various range of products. This time with Galaxy M33 5G 8GB variant they have live up to their expectation in offering best of products.Pros:Battery life - with 6000mAh battery its stays solid even for 2 days even with high usage of social media.Performance - excellent with 8GB RAM variant and 120hz refresh rate its really fast. Though it is exynos Processor from usage wise you will not feel the difference.Camera - Pretty good, best that I can offer at this price rangeLook and feel - very stylish and cool rich colorCons:Fingerprint - as this is side mounted which is very annoying even when we hold the phone.
Please  refer :-1 Display - 3.25/52 Processor - 3.8/53 Battery - 4.4/54 Rear Camera - 3.8/55 Front Camera - 3.2/56 Design - 4.4/57 Display protection - 4.5/58 Interface(OS) - 4.29 Mic - 4.7/510 Speaker - 3.65/511 Camera Flash - 3.2/512 Value for money - 3.8/5This review is based on my personal usage statistics/feedback.
Its a good  mobile
Ok
Product is good,But amezon service is very poor27 days complete a replacement order.😊
I bought it after comparing it with many other models and brands. It really suits all my needs of everyday usage, it has a very fast processor so you can use screen split and multi-app use smoothly. The processor is complemented with a powerful 6k mAH battery so it can last easily for 1 day and charge really quickly in around 1.5 hrs from 20 % to 90+. I bought the original 25W adapter along with the mobile and hence, I received discount of 5% and in all, I bought mobile+ charger for 17k which is a good deal considering the RAM, processor and 5G.I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a premium looking phone as all my friends couldn't believe that it is under 20k as the mystique green colour gives it a premium look and the weight is evenly distributed so feels comfortable to use as well.
Phone feels hot on mild use and side mounted finger print scanner is at wrong position whenever i hold my phone in my hands its keep vibrating due to exposure of scanner to my palm and shows message on screen  too my attempts please unlock via pattern. How to avoid touching finger print scanner while you are holding your phone in your hands?
The phone is good in terms of display, build quality, battery and performance without any lags. But proximity is not there which essentially degrades the user experience during calls, they may use jargon like virtual sensor etc but all that is of no use.
This is definitely The best Android phone in the market available at this price range, it's a must purchase and affordable for everyone, Many many thanks to Samsung and Amazon for bringing to us this amazing product at this affordable price
I have to charge the Battery after 2 days of usage which is the best part
Handset was good but charging adaptor is not provided.
IT IS EXCELLENT
Battery life is not as expected.
Bought this phone on the launch day and delivered on the same day. Exchanged my 5 yrs old M30, I feel it's a fine decision to buy M33 5g in all aspects. Good processor with enough RAM and internal storage. Only regret I have is Display. It is not AMOLED and LCD display will not be good for a users who fond of AMOLED.
Ok
Phone is good
Most of the time you will have service issues. Also video kyc can't be done using camera of any Samsung devices.


                    The media could not be loaded.


 Refresh rate is so good no lag good performance
Okay 👍
It is bit heavy. Camera is just average. Too many Preloaded apps.
Good and best
Phone is value for money....product quality is excellent....only thing is it should come with a fast charger
first of all,camera quality is very poor..battery backup is awesome..everything else is good ,as expected from samsung..
Batterly life is good.
Everything looks and work fine, except the battery. At very minimal usage, the battery is not lasting for 1 full day. I've a 2 years old NOKIA 5.4, that is still performing better than this phone on battery front. I fear that if it's used heavily, the battery may not last for 6-7 hours. Keep this in your mind when you plan to buy this.
Camera quality is not good as expected
Over All Good Phone in budget for the features it offers (5g, 6000mah battery, good Processor, good pixels back camera). One thing for gamers who play high graphic mobile games, may be you wont enjoy playing on this phone screen type(LCD).
A good phone. Only 2 cons:1. Battery drains esrlirr than expected2. Camera quality is okayTo those who are complaining of Charger not present in accessories.  Guys, it was mentioned before hand that adapter has to bought separately. Overall. I am satisfied with the phone.
Everything is good about mobile but body looks somewhat tilted slightly. Mobile is not getting charged fully even in 24 hrs. Also earphone connection gets disconnected frequently though the mobile is 2 months old . Worst
I purchased M33 5G few days ago. Handset is really good. Battery backup is winderful. Screen is also good. BTW charging adapter is neither available on samsung portal nor at their stores. Camera quality is not up to the mark. But still I am happy.
Ok
No issues
No charger
Nice phone for the price
The finger print reader is bad unable to set it up. Camera quality is good. M series is available only on the net . The phone quality is good.
Camera Quality Awesome 50 MP clicking mind blowing pics
All good
SAMUNG TAKING YOU FOR A RIDE. ITS LIKE BUY A CELL FONE BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA TO BUY A CHARGER.EVER HEARD OF ANY COMPANY NSELLING FONE WITHOUT A CHARGER ITS JUST TO SHOW THAT THEIR PRODUCT IS LOW PRICED COMPARED TO OTHERSIN MY FAMILY I HAVE PLENTY OF CELL FONES [SAMUNG INCLUDED]BUT NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD EXPERIENCEIF THEY WANTED THBEY COULD HAVE GIVEN A COMMON CORD WHICH CAN BE USED BY ANY OTHER ADAPTER  BUT NO THEY TRIED TO PLAY A GMICK  AND LOST A CUSTOMER  NEVER SHALL I RECOMENT OR BUY SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN
Best phone to buy.
Good mobile
There is no travel adapter and no amoled display which should've  been  there especially  when you are spending close to 19k, apart from this rest of the phone is great. Good camera, good battery and good processor.
Phone is value for money. Only problem is phone gets over heating during charging and long use.
Good handset
I am a loyal Samsung Mobile user with all 4 adults in my family using SAMSUNG devices. And our experience with Samsung was great UNTIL NOW.M33 5G is a bundle of endless pains and problems, like:* Slow response time, so STAY AWAY FROM EXYNOS PROCESSORS* Below average camera (foggy images) and screen resolution (compared to even phones from Chinese brands costing 25% lower than M33 5G)* Keeps losing mobile network, Wi-Fi calling needs to be reset every couple of hours and hotspot for some reason practically doesn't work* Lower than expected battery backup - 2 hours in a VC and it starts huffing and puffingIn summary, I will need to replace this phone in a few months, and I will still go for a Samsung one more time hoping that my next device takes behind my earlier Samsung phones and not the current one i.e. M33 5G.
First of all excellent battery backup and 25 watt fast charges it in almost 1.5 hrs. Camera is good and processor is also nice. Display quality is also very good as comparing to its lcd panel. It should be considered a good phone in long term usage as it provides 2 year os update.
Good
No charger provided
I bought the Samsung M33 5G the day it released, and I've been using it since then. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my new phone! The phone is buttery smooth to use - transitions when switching apps, the ease with which I can have multiple apps running simultaneously, etc are great. The camera is really really good too - with minimal effort, photographs can be clicked with good quality and clarity.I had a Samsung M30 previously, and even though the price difference isn't that high, this felt like a HUGE upgrade as the phone feels premium. Another difference I noticed is that the phone is definitely thicker than my old phone, but it's still very comfortable to use.I'm still exploring some of the features as it's only been a few days, but I'm loving the experience so far!
Good
The phone is good for me as I don't  play games, mainly for battery duration, mostly used for calls, msgs plus some work and travel apps, camera is ok like a 12mp camera. Selfie camera is like 5mp. RAM is 6gb which makes the phone bit faster. With exchange of my old phone + credit card discount the overall costed me below 10k, which makes my purchase worth till now.
Very Good product in Samsung. Best battery life and build quality. TFT Screen but good quality images. Worth of Product in this budget
I just want to say awesome. Only there is no AMOLED display in this phone otherwise it is the best phone.
Even with screenguard and backcover, the phone showed problems when it fell 2 times from a normal height and the touch became erroneus. Don't go for it if you can't take extreme care
So far the configuration which I was looking for has met based on ram, rom, and processor + battery capacity which is simply awesome combo. I was looking at the configuration for processing point of view rather than the display.People who is looking for the display then it is tft tech rather than the latest currently used or available in the medium range mobile phone. Although medium range mobile now a days don't providee a dedicated micro SD slot which is totally not TRUE in case of galaxy m33 as it has a dedicated memory card slot to expand the memory. Which is quite handy and easy to manage.The drawback I could easily see is the camera pixel which could have been more at this price as well as design and especially tft display (old tech) and lastly bit overpriced.
Good battery life and only disappointed with heavy weight phone.all over great phone in mid range.
Na
Great battery life and best performance annd camera quality in this price range.It comes with all the features .Doesn't lag.
Amazing phone introduce by Samsung this Year Having Premium Features  at affordable Price.Fingerprint and battery life is awesome.Camera quality is good for this price range.I Recommend to everyone to buy Samsung only. Don't buy Chainease phones..Think before you Buy..
Battery life good
The phone is good overall in its segment, mainly the battery durability is good. Only few feedback to the brand, they should enhance the endoor network bands. Camera clarity is also very good
I have always been a fan of Samsung products -opting for this product was due to same preference .overall satisfied only drawback being the lack of travel adapter-if the adapter is not provided then what's the need to provide cord.
1. Processor is good.2. Camera pictures quantity is fine3. Fingerprint sensor work fine4. Sound quality superb5. Overall this handset is good.
Good
Good
I order this phn with exchange of my old phn which is Samsung galaxy j6 and on the time of delivery the delivery guy said I pay 400 rupee more because my old pun dispaly is little bit of blue colour otherwise I cancel my order then I pay him bt that is not good if that is issu then gave me option about to describe my phn bt this is disappointed and very bad experience with amazon
just as i was expecting, arrived on time, box was closed.nice
littel heavy but good
Awsome
It doesn't have it's own applock
Pros:It is an excellent mobile with this price range. I bought this for Rs.14850 (Prime day sale :) )Battery life is too good. For complete 100% charge, you would get more than 2 days with high usage aswell.Camera quality is good.Have option to switch the refresh rate (useful for saving battery life)Cons:Since battery is 6000mAH, the mobile weighs heavy than other mobiles.Finger print sensor is not very good.
Fingerprint reader 4/5 with cover kavi kavi kam nehi karta he,without cover always kam karta he.Battery 5/5Camera quality front ka acha nehi he,back camera acha he.Magar mere phone ek problem dikha he samsung balo ko bola he
Samsung has been pushing few apps being installed behind the software update, Samsung is forcefully installs these apps on our phone without our permission as part of their some deal with these app developers.This is really Annoying specially for elders who has no clue about thisBattery life is good if you don't watch any videos, if you start watching videos battery will be drained in a hour or soAlso basic feature like App Lock is missing (which comes in other android phones). I want to keep apps out of reach from kids, but seems there is no straight forward way for this
Phone is not good,My exp.1. Wifi connected on two phones, one on this samsumng and second on other, even after connection is connected, on samsung 5G mobile wifi shows poor quality network and dont allow to run, while other mobile working on same network without any issue with full speedSome time even after having 4G internet connection the mobile show no internet connection, while other phone with same network shows network and show good speed.Phone main use is connectivity if its poor what is use of having phone?Fingerprint is ok, battery ok, speed ok but connectivity pathetic
Nice
This  product  is very good.  Price  is also good fingerprint secncer is very good. Camera quality is very good.  Phone is  very bestSome times  phone  is  hitting in normal uses
Liked:Samsung UI - lagfree and smoothBattery Backup5G Ready - in case the service is made available in futureDisliked:Display is TFT - not good and soothing to eyes. Reflection on screen is prominentHeavy because of higher capacity batteryCamera is not great
Worth for money
I have used samsung  j7 6, on 5pro, A8+.They did good performance as per them price, But this phone camera quality not good as per price and brand. and battery not perform like 6000 mah. charger also buy separately. It's reallynot good in this price.Totally disappointed.😔😔
Charger should also be included with product
Bought for my in laws because they wanted something in budget and supported 5g. Initial feedback is good overall. Build quality is descent and features to seem upto the mark.
Average
No adapter only cable.its pathatic
In terms of ease of use, smoothness, touch id is a bit odd from side compared to Samsung Galaxy S9 which I used earlier but it's one of the most featured and affordable phone.
The device is too heavy , your hand starts aching if you operate with single hand. Took this as a gift to my dad but regret for its weight. Performance n touch gestures are smooth n nice though.
Nice product in this price range.
Excellent battery, lasts 2 days, slightly slow when using several apps.
At this price point it is good product
Pros. 1. Relatively clean  UI as compared to other android brands. Many Pre-installed apps are easy to uninstall.2. Decent camera setup. 3. Decent battery ( Pls note I am not avid gamer) 4. Made in India 5. Knox security featureCons: 1. Bit heavier 2. No s-amoled screen at this price range 3. No in the box charger (one need to speed 1149 extra on samsung fast charger). In box charger would have made it value for money.Recommendations: Who should buy- 1. Those who like Samsung UI and brand can buy. 2. Those who need disruption free internet while traveling and carry two SIMS
The screen,camera quality,finger print reader I have been satisfied but only with  it's very  slow to charge but the battery life is moreNICE MOBILE
Good phone for the priceDisplay GoodCamera GoodFront AverageBattery life Good
Display is color TFT which is not so good as amoled.Note that 'replacement' is permitted but no refund.Speed is good.Battery life is awesome.Little heavy.
Nice,battery life is good, camera has many features, sound is crisp and clear,using from six months had no problem.
I am writing this review after using this phone for 6 months. The issues faced buy me are over heating, Camera quality Poor while taking pics in night,. The phone is not 5G enable, earlier I thought it was due Jio then I shifted to Airtel, the calls on both the networks get disconnected in between the calls. I have written many times to Samsung India Initially they have not responded after  sending almost 5 to 8 reminders, they ask me to visit service centre.  SERVICE CENTER not provided any satisfactory reply.  Please do not waste your hard earned money to buy this pathetic Samsung phone. I lost my trust on Samsung
Battery life doesn't seem to be like 6000 mAh.Selfie Camera should be improved and screen display should be AMOLED.There should be a notification LED light for incoming notifications.Performance wise Exynos 1280 is 👌
Got this mobile in big discount.  Display quality is very good and battery life is good comes for more than one day with moderate usage. Sound quality is good. No hanging and heating issue. Over all I am satisfied  with this mobile.
Phone pack box is already teared.Packaging quality is poor, just packed phone box in amazon cover thats it no proper amazon box pack.No Adapter in box, need to buy again.Cable has 2 sides C type port.Phone look is good, screen appearance is too good and crystal clear. Total poly body.
Super
Screen at 120 hz is better as butter .... Battery is very huge and optimised very well , superfast charger (25watts ) which you can buy additionally online works just fine and has a significant difference in charging time
Adopter issue very dislike point m33 very heavy in weight 215 gram
Very nice 👍👌👌👌
Good. For  games
Pros..Battery, Charging speed, 3.5mm jack, dual Sim slot and Sd card slot..120htz frame rate, UI, On time Software updates.Cons.. Can not play BGMI on higher graphics also processor does not support Gaming effectively. Camera is avg. Images appear blurr and less clarity, odd colours..Need 1.8 apr for lense...Very heavy to carry, Most worst part is display.. it is TFT...not able to enjoy Dark mode..it appears faint anoying coffee colour..Touch response is also issue...Finger pri t scanner location is odd and problematic also.
Overall good phone but I received my phone in which on the right side panel and the bottom panel of the phone has some scratches on it otherwise good phone... And it appears in some parts as if the screen is sticked by glue and if u order for replacement they send a technician or a inspection app so that u cannot return it and ask for a replacement for minor issues... If there are some scratches it wouldn't be a new phone and neither there would be the feelings of a new phone. Also the adapter we have to buy separately. Otherwise no problem with the phone
Writing this review after 1 week of use1. Value for money- 5g phone, battery backup of almost 1.5 days with normal use.2. Camera quality is just awesome, liked multiple camera settings provided within app.3. Didn't observe any lag or delay, fingerprint sensor is also good.
Use 1month fully satisfied
Everything was Mind-blowing Awesome 😍😍But when you deliver any mobile or any other electronic products please give them in a sturdy box.My delivery was not quite good .The package was destroyed but my mobile phone was safe ☺️☺️☺️☺️Thanks Amazon for this nice mobile phone ☺️☺️😍
Over all features are upto the mark, all sensors, Samsung UI, Samsung processor gives you complete performance.
Display is broken, its fall from hight of leg knee. i had only 3 month from purchase its under warranty but samsung service center person said physical damage is not coverd and the display replacement price is around 5000rs...if we purchase 5000rs display there is not any kind of warranty. it is third class display. it is easily break...samsung need to work...for low quality display to provide phisical damage warranty.
Good
A perfect phone for the price range. Very good battery life and decent camera. Using it for more than a month now and didn't face any issues so far. The only downside is, it is bit heavy so you may feel a bit of pain on your fingers when you rest it on them for longer time. Also the charger is not provided which is an additional cost.Overall it is a perfect phone for normal use.
Best camera quality, stunning experience, superfast cahrging. Screen resolution is superb.! I am very satisfied but only one thing that battery backup is not so good. Overall it is the best phone for middleclass.
Nice mobile
Very useful
Sumsang M33 5G camera quality awesome. Over all look is good. Charger is not coming with handset which is clearily mentioned on the time of ppurchased. you got best value in this price range.
Cons: 1 colours of captured image is dull might get good in update2. Yellowish tint in display, might get better in update.3. No charger (1200rs)no back cover, no screen protector4. 25w charging is not fast like my narzo 20 pro 65w
Build Quality is Average.Display is good.Battery life is good.Cameras are just average while front camera is mediocre.UI is good but contain bloatwares.Performance is satisfactory for price.Overall its just an "Average Smartphone" from Samsung.Consider this smartphone only at discounted rates,Not worth spending more that 13-14k for this phone.
Nothing
Front camera quality is poor. And too mutch slow mobile.
Product is very good having new features. Battery drains within 1.5 days with normal use. Side Fingerprint sensor and edge panel is new features. Overall good product with this price range.
I was previously using Samsung M31 for 2 year and till now it haven't given me any technical problem.This phone made me upgrade to Samsung M33 8gb Variant where I bought and used it for 2 weeks around and its a very good phone The screen is very good. And the camera also is very good .The processor is fantastic multitalsking is very convient and till now it hasn't given me any problem likeag or hanging and also the noice cancellation option while calling is very usefull.Overall its a very good phone and budget friendly. I got all the option available in high end phone.I loved the phone..!I recommend others to buy this phone.
Excellent
Camera and tuch is best for this phone
At price point of 18k i would say that its a good buy with the experience of samsung's ONE UI 4.1 with android 12 and 5g with a latest 5nm processor and its battery backup is just amazing thanks to its 6000mah battery and regarding its ips display its an okayy type of display but as we all know that samsung's amoled is the best so kinda missing that one coming to its camera in day light it captures great photos with main camera but ultra wide images are somewhat soft as its a 5mp one and selfies are also good at this price point. And its photos Are close to natural images. N its back design literally looks above average regardless of it having a plastic back.
Worst Camara clarity
Happy using itGood phoneDraw back had to spend extra on adapter, and all other accessories not provided with the phone
Observed its for 5 days..... Its good. Quality and price meets the requirement. Overall nice product.
Great phone for a mid-ranger smartphone. One UI is far better than other Chinese UI. Display is amazing, and camera's are good at this price range.Therefore a nice package for a budget smartphones under 16K.
I got it on my ICICI card with Rs 4000 off
First of all this phone is of my best ever experienced phone Samsung. & I wish there could be a Samsung guarilla glass protection for both the sides of the phone. I also wish there would be a travel charger alongwith the the phone. As headphones doesn't come at Amazon now days. But I haven't checked any other site yet.
Huge memory and fast and excellent camera.
Dislike
It's been just couple of days of usage. I don't have any concerns as of now. It would be nice if travel adapter, back cover and temper glass would be included the package.
Moving from galaxy S10, was a bit hesitant. But after using for 2 weeks, am very satisfied with battery life, dual SIM data feature, camera, dedicated microSD slot, etc., Have to check how 5G works when I travel out of India in next few days.The cons, which are not huge, are that no charger is included and hence had to order a 25w Samsung charger, screen being LCD - the blacks are not as black but overall not bad at all. Compared to S10, M33 is a little heavy and thick because of the huge battery. Most features that I use on S10 including Samsung Pay, quick access pane, secure folder are available on M33. Overall, very happy with the decision to move to M33.
Pros:Samsung UI , price, Android 12, Good features like fingerprint and face unlock.Cons:No charger. But if you buy in samsung.com, they are giving free 25W charger.Some bloatware. You need to uninstall or disable them, otherwise the notifications will bother.
Phone battery back up super, finger print also
Used for almost 2 months, battery doesnt seems to be of 6000 mAh in performance however in weight u can feel it. Camera is so so. Processor is not OK. It gets hanged very soon. Doesnt worth it.
I just started using the phone from past 3 days and everything was good till evening.But all of a sudden, display has went blank even though I can feel the vibrations and hear receiving calls/message tones. Based on Google search results I am trying to sort out the issue from past few hours, but nothing helped me out. This is absolute shocker to me. Can I get immediate Customer Support here??
Budget mobile
Mobile heating issues, TFT display not up to mark.bad experience with display. camera quality not markable. apart from everything fine.
There is no always on display on this phone......big turn down. Very sad to see this
don't expect a lot guys, phone is ok ok. it is heating a lot i don't know why even though all i did was to se it up.amazon exchange was good and i got is for 15k.i think on paper it may look like good purchase, but it has no charger and it costs Rs 1000 for new samsung 25W charger. it is loot.if you get it less than 14500 then buy or go for other option.three star only because amazon was good, phone was fine but not as good as expected
Best for this price
I am not using finger printBattery life and charging time are excellent
I got this at 13k by applying ICICI credit card of 2500 and at this rate very nice phone
Very nice 👍
It's a must buy product. Earlier I used to think twice before buying a costly phone. But Galaxy M33 5G solved all my doubts. Many are posting negative reviews about this product. But I suggest u to not hesitate to buy so that u can experience a quality product from Samsung with condition it should be priced below 20k. The best part is It's color effect and clarity
Good handset but not premium series so in this price samsung add travel adopter and ear phone.
Excellent fingerprint readerBattery life is too goodCamera is awesome 👌
I found a big bug in this phone specially when u connected over wifi for an hour incomming and outgoing call gives no voice even on speaker too. This problem only will resolve by restart the phone. Which usually required to more than a 5 times in a day.phone is quite bigger and not able to handle by one hand also camwera quality is ok not good in this price range. Very disappointed
The all new Samsung Galaxy M33 5G is one of the best phone that I have tried. It has a 50 megapixel camera which is great. It has a processor of a rather flagship phone the Samsung Galaxy A53, the Exynous 1280 which is very powerfully. It comes with a whopping 6000 mAh battery which lasts all day long even with heavy usage. If you are looking for a flagship phone in a budget, this is the one.
I previously used J6. That was the best phone and I am stuck with Samsung, but m33 seems to be similar in many things. No difference from J6 as I expected. It was good for the first 3 weeks and keeps hanging while I watch any kind of videos. I felt that my old phone j6 is much better than this. I am not completely satisfied.
Company mentioned that travel adaptor should be bought separately..people  must read specs of the product before buying instead of Blamimg the co. that they are not providing charger or no charger in the box. Must read the specs before buying any product
Phone is good smooth in use camera quality is also good just a drowback samsung did not give charger and headphone with the phone you will only get phone data cable that's all. Copying IOS not a great experience. In this price samsung should not remove charger from the box.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G is friednly user. easy to use. Batery life is also very good.  finger print i am not tested. overall Samsung Galaxy M33 5G is excellent.
Good product
Value for money
Finger print reader is too fast.Battery is okay but not too good backup.Camera is nice. Not bad.Totally mobile is good. Suggest for buying. Thanks.
Camera and performance is good as I mostly play ges like CALL of duty and NFS but didn't  found any lag jn touch or also nk heating issue.Good product in this price range.
Super
Model 6gb ramNo charger and the cable provided in the box is type c both end.Phone starts heating when charging using the provided cableGlass Material body in the behind of the phone getting cracked even protected with mobile coverLCD Display and pain in the eyes more than couple of hours of useCamera not so good
Ok
Battery socksCamera is not worth it according to the price
Excellent
Best mobile i am happy from amazon and Samsung 👍
Nice expression
Battery life is very good. Phone is bit heavy
I have been using Samsung mobiles in last 3 years after Motorola & my confidence is now with Samsung phones as well.M33 5g is a best series in this price range & build quality is good. Look wise you can't say unique. It is looking like redmi phones.In the package charger is not included hence cost will get higher along with charger. Only c-c type cable available that means with this cable you can not connect your mobile with your PC.Overall phone is good & will recommend to all. & if your budget is Lil bit higher you can wait & Go for M53 5G which will be launch on 22nd April 2022.
Good

சூப்பர்
Camera is good,finger print sensor good, battery life good,apps functional also but only dual option is not available on Samsung only fb,and wats app only is there so hear i am not happy
Good...
ProsThe phone performance is good. Camera is decent.ConsIf you are stock android user then you will not love it.Samsung is not giving adaptor.
I have been using this for few months, have not faced any problem
Phone sticks very often , restarting all time is really bad, battery life no use ,though it shows 100% it dips as sudden to 60 and then next 1 hour dip 30...very bad design
Super 👌
I am using M33 from last 15days. Its overall performance it better. Front camera should be more better. Rear camera is best. Overall good product......satistisfied with Samsung
i love this , i dont know on a long run how it will be , its very simple neat and easy to use and cost effective
Display is amazing. Don't get distracted from youtube videos. Camera and picture quality is at the top notch. Object erase and video editing option is add on. Battery life is good which support 2 days. No charger adapter in box only C to C type cable so need to purchase separately which will cost you extra 800-1000. No lagging or heating issue so far. Samsung lover go for it.
Good product for normal used.
Fast charging ' Good battery backup, Good camera quality,
Fringer print, face detection,Does not do correctly and quickly
Good product overall. Screen flickers sometimes while scrolling. Although no issues from processor capability. Maybe its not optimised enough. Camera is just okay. Dont be negative when you hear TFT screen, its a good screen panel almost equal to an IPS LCD.
Been using this phone for a month now...Screen is just ok... Tft display is not very good.Camera quality is bad!.. A regular Pic with a little zoom in get noisy.Phone is heavy, u get tired in some time.6000 amp battery doesn't not last very long.I got a 8 gb ram model! And its way slower than my earlier 6gb phone.Is not a value for money buy! Avoid
Nice
Battery Quality, Finger print is no doubt very good.Camera and Processing Speed can be improved.Camera quality expected more from Samsung in this range.
Mobile look very Nice and many new features are there....Good Memory Specs...Cool display.. Easy handling of apps...camera photos are good And futuristic... Over all good performances... I am satisfied..
Battery is the top in the like list.Then comes camera in such a price range.Processor and performance are also we'll for the price segment.Only as usual or all phone of Samsung's model the width of the phone is not like Motorola model.More is yet to update after using for few days.There is no charger adapter.
More or less same as M32 with little changes.Good phone for daily use, not a luxury model.Finger print sensor is on side button, which takes more time in detecting and  unlocking. Needs more accuracy in that.
Battery backup is not good. It's not stand by not even a single day fully. After drain out it will take 2 hour's and 43 min to gain 85% by original 25 watts fast charger. By normal means it will take just 8 hour's only for 73%. Apart from that nothing big issues with this phone.Note ..... There is no charger with this phone.No lag in apadt 1 TB memory card.Camera parameters also okay.Smooth performance.....but we can't enjoy it because of these battery backup issues.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G (6GB with 128GB Storage), and 6000mAh Battery is an excellent mobile phone
Very good and nice product
Cheapest phone ever in 5g category.
Average battery life
😄
Brought for dad for around 12k on offer. Promising updates and security, feature wise a good phone for use by elders. Few features like adaptive brightness, notification lights & haptic feedback, Dual speakers missing. However a phone with good hardware n software.
Would like to inform I just talked with samsung representative, told samsung M33 device always delivered with charger as well, but don’t know how these sellers are selling without charger dock to make their profits higher..
Don't go for this phone, for 17k Samsung as provided a LCD screen and display clarity is pathetic and more to that don't buy phones is amazon since if you don't like the phone you cannot exchange that for any other phone. Disappointed with purchase overall.
Rocking phone
Finger sensor not working properly
ok
Valeu for mony
Camera quality is great...tft display is average...Great deal at 14499
Camera is not so good
I bought it for daily average usage.Camera is not good enough.Battery backup lasts for more than a day. Overall descent phone.
Camera photo quality not ok
Nice for parents
overall good
Why adapter not supplied alongwith mobile
Sound effects are wrost.  If you buy for good sound it's not good option.  My 5 year old lenovo k 8 plus has much better dolby effects than this new phone. Bass is the weakest point.
Phone is just ok ,u can use but can't feel that wow wala feelings .
I just needed a good, simple and nice mobile which doesn't create any issues with my use regarding my work life. And it is serving good enough.
Good product
No Travel adopter and no Headphones, is looking bad for samsung. even though 6000mah the battery backup  is not good for TFT display which drain the power, and many pre-installed  application  make phone sanky
Good
Phone is little bit heavier..Not satisfied with fingerprint sensorRegarding camera it is niceOverall the phone is good..
Don't buy this junk phone. I showed when know 5g is not working in this phone. May be only some 5g band working but most of in 5g coverage not working.  I complain in samsung but customer care says we give u usoftware update but still update not received. Not accepted from big samsung brand. Now built quality is also not good from samsung.
Excellent.  Go for it.
Amazon delayed delivery for non prim customers, last purchase on Amazon,  phone is v good,  I read some reviews for tft display,  but its good display,  phone performance is good battery is osm, samsung ui is also good
Good phone. Fast Delivery. No charger in the box. Normal TFT Panel with great refresh rate. Rear cam is good but the front selfie camera is kinda poor. Don't get your expectations high. Got some nice features and decent performance for the price. It seem little pricey for the whole package but hey, its Samsung.
Very good features for mid range budgetThe phone has very good camera and sound.Long lasting battery.Only downside is it does not come with charging adapter.It comes with data cable of type C and we have to purchase the charging adaptor separately for about 1400.It also has a port for wired earphones.Overall is a great phone for those with a budget of under 20,000
Mast, in 15000
Fingerprint sensor is very fast, battery charging time less & no drain fast, this is sufficient for full day use, camera quality also very good even night also
Battery life is OKDisplay is okBut front camera is not good in this budget over all phon is good with Samsung privacy
Excellent phone,value for money,good display even though lcd,good battery life
Heating issue arises while accessing the phone. And also adapter should be provided with the phone. C Type cable at both ends finds difficult to charge the phone as the adapter needs to be purchased separately. Rest everything is fine with the product.
Display us average, everything rest is okk
Gd
Good
I bought it for my Father He is satisfied with it , battery performance is good....


                    The media could not be loaded.


 Cons :1.Heavy weight2.Sometimes while using finger print it is asking to(use pattern to unlock due to security policy reson)3.No option for lock screen wakeup for notifications,Samsung should work on wakeup lockscreen on notifications.4. Paid around 1k for charger.5. While purchasing Samsung mobils in offer 25w charger price goes high.without offer with mobile  they given at 299.Pros:1.Happy i got mobile at 14k.2. Value for money in all aspects.3. 2 android and 3 years security updates.
It doesn't have assitive ball feature, don't show net speed, don't have inbuilt app lock, heats very fast, low battery lag a lot and have a lot more cons but there are pros too. Have a better camera features, battery lasts 4-5 hours while playing heavy games and lot more.All in all atbest average for gamers and best fit for office workers!
Difference super
The phone is really good and fast and it has an amazing camera but the only thing is that there was no ctype charger given with the phone.
Best phone under budget segment.ProsGood cameraProcessorSmooth 120 hz refresh rateConNeed to buy charger extraNotch displaySlightly bulky
Samsung M33 8gb/128gb mobile is excellent product.Excellent performance.Log battery backup.Thanks & RegardsPankaj Prajapati
Good battery life, charges quicklyFingerprint reader is good addition
If u are a camera lover,  will not recommend this phone. Battery life is good, slightly over Weight, not happy with graphics.


                    The media could not be loaded.


 Mobile charger mein adapter miss hai only data cable mili hai
I like a phone but adapter is not able. And adapter not able in marketing. Know what I can do know
OK.....not super....
Fingerprint reader is very good,batter life is also good and camera quality is average. Overall performance of mobile is good.
The auto brightness is a mess the brightness goes up and down po fast that's bit off
Value of money
Really happy with this. decent phone at this budget and the performance is good as expected.
Very good
Really Happy for this product and I get it discount price from Amazon. Thank you Amazon
Good phone1. Excellent camera 2. Very good battery backup, 3. fingerprint scanner 9 out of 10 4. Face unllock not very fast 5. Display quality very good comparable to IPS LCD
Super
Phone is Heating so much don't know what to do now.
mobile is best
Adapter is not provided in the box and the mobile is thicker than normal.
Heating problem 😕Video call pe he heat ho jana hai ik dum kabad phone waste of money please don't buy this phone ise Asha to realme opo vivo hai jo heat to nhi hote
Seems slowness while openings apps. Getting visible delay.
Phone overall is okay-ish. Unlike other brand phones, this phone’s  facial unlocking feature is very cumbersome.  Battery life is ok. Camera on such a phone at this price point is expected to deliver better quality photos, videos.
M33 is an excellent phone with regards to the camera quality and ease of use.The brightness and display is crisp and clearGood battery lifeGreat volume controlVery good camera ⋅
Value for money
Excellent 👌
Everything is okay face unlock and camera quality is worst
All good. Sorry for inconvenience. The SIM ejector and data cable was in envelope kept in packet
No
Just average performance. Sometimes it hangs too. Camera is not so bad, display quality very good and feels good on hand.
Good
All over good only one thing is distress pls provide charger in box pls
Bettery is good and camera quantity also good .
Performance and look wise its good.Back camera works awesome.Front camera is low quality.
Pros: 1. More than 24hrs of battery life (Moderate use)2. Light weight compared to the size of the battery capacity3. Not too bulky to hold, one hand operation is possible for any normal size hand.4. Superior processor (but wait)5. Responsive screen6. Good built quality, gives a premium feel.Cons. 1. Underperformance, 120hz refresh rate is just a gimmick, animations are just at par to 60hz screens.2. Display has reddish tint. Colours are not as accurate.3. Camera is the absolutely worst. Do not fall for "50MP QUAD camera setup". It clicks pictures as equivalent to a 5MP camera.4. Over smoothing out effect on picture ruins every click.5. Over correction of colour in Camera, pictures look unnatural.6. In low light condition, do not even bother to open the camera.7. Too many bloatware both 1st & 3rd party, took hours to debloat it.Final verdict: Spend few more bucks and get better phone or spend less and save some money, get a lower spec phone and replace every 2 years or so.PS: Still better than any other Chine*se companies (You know which are those)
Its been around 20 days since I purchase the phone for my wife. The phone has been working perfectly till now. Screen , camera, Battery are all behaving as expected.Due to 6000mAH battery, the phone is on the bulkier side, but that was an expectation. Also we hoped that the earlier samsung charger will perform fine with this device but unfortunately it takes a long time to charge with the same. So absence of a charger along with the device does hurts a bit, but again a known fact while buying.Overall, it seems to be a happy purchase till now.
Phone is good but front cam very bad.Drop Notch outdated and camera quality is bad.No charger included.
received it intime and worthy for buying this model
Over all good. But after  open multiple apps in this phone ,phone getting warm. And second thing is yhat the adapter doesn't include in the box 🙄 very disappointed.
Great
திருப்தி.
Good performance, Good Camera, Good Battery Backup. Nice Look. Sometimes the phone reboots when opening the camera.
The mobile is good. I have purchased in exchange and it is not having a charger,earphones
It's good samsung mobile in this range
Samsung galaxy M33 5g is good mobile in middle range under 15k. Display screen is TFT and brightness is very high. Rear camera is good but front camera is not good for selfie.
Very bad Camera quality
Sound
Heavy phone. Inaccessible fingerprint sensor. Difficulty in recognising sim
I bought it in july 2022. 2 months it was ok. Since September I observed that there is no voice while dialing outgoing to incoming call. After restart the device it is working fine. After sometime same problem. Now a day it's frequently problem. Didn't expect such quality issue with Samsung device.
Good
Good but battery average and adaptor not included issue
Phone texture is good but there's no charger
Will review latter
Apart from it should have a adapter in the box, it is a very good mobile
Why these mobile companies are making fools to customers because they putting 50 mp camera but working has old digital camera...This is miracle...
Good product i like it
Samsung has increased the weight of this phone soo much, but feel it very heavy in hand or in pocket compared to its competitors.
The battery  life is amazing normally  70% charge pass your 2 days with normal  usuage.
I am using this as my primary device since a week.Pros:1) great battery life2) good display, you won't realise the difference between tft and amoled3) good sound quality it is loud.!4) the phone handles multi tasking well5) feels premium for a mid range phoneCons.6) good camera quality1) phone is slightly heavy2) would have been nice to not have spent 1000 odd rs. On a charger but then again Samsung clearly mentions what is in the box before you buy it.Even with the extra charger cost the phone is great at this price point.

 The colour combination of the images are good,super slow motion works well,portrait also works well....good processor....battery backup is also good...wifi works pretty well even from a long distance....though it's a tft display its crisp enough.. according to the price I must say good value for money from a brand like Samsung....
Phone is very good, but a little bit heavy compared to my old phones
Camera quality is awesome 😊 i like it😍
Good brand and nice model
It's been a week using this mobile,  satisfied with the overall performance...
The interface is with any bugs. Looks like released without doing proper tsstiof the prod.
Good phone in low budget
Good phone ..
very very good smart phone
Gets stuck, data is very slow with compared to the same network in other device, even tested by using same sim card in other device. Touch performance is poor. There are some other brand which are very good at this price. In simple terms waste of money.
Good one
Great phone under 20k
Ya definately like the mobile but it is little bulky.
Kam range me achhchha hai
Worth to buy even in 16k, although I get it in 14.5k
This phone did not justify the price 19000. All these features are also available in rs  14000 phone also. This chipped have problem in longer run and screen is not amelod .
Nice product happy
Battery is awesomeCameras are goodOnly lagging part is slow charging
Decent phone and battery life. Would have liked it with the travel adapter. Camera quality is good enough for my requirements and the price range.
good quality packing and tamper proofreceived material without any damage as if I purchased at a show room
Best phone for this price. Worst part - no charging adapter given. So i had to buy samsung fast charger adapter. Satified for 12k(with exchange of old) budgeted 6gb 128gb phone.


                    The media could not be loaded.


 It's been few days since I've been using it and no issues found with the phone, go for it guys it's original and really amazing to gift your loved ones.
Camera is good.finger touch sometime not working and battery issue is there. Phone gets hot very soon.
Too many unnecessary apps. Battery is good.
Screen needs anti reflection
Even after music and background other apps its working amazing
Good
Itna mahengai mobile , without charger mei purchase karna par raha hei
Don't be confused just because of exynos processor. Just buy and see the performance. Its fantastic with zero lags.  I have not played games and by the way i am sure most of the people do not play pubg like games  others it can handle with charm. Looks premium and the display is also very bright and colors are punchy and 120hz adaptive refresh rate is a plus. Overall a perfect smart for almost all the users who want a well balanced and want a nice and secure software experience below 20k.
I am not happy with this phone. SMS is not working with company installed OS. I had tough time to get gpay, amazon pay working. Still some of the apps are not working. like sodexo. some developers bugs are there. :)
Travel Adapter not include as per mobile .other wise good.. little bit weight ..good model
The purchase is worth for money. Samsung is at its best. Wonderful purchase in such a price range.
Nice phone but charge adapter is not available.Rear camera better.I m using old Samsung galaxy j7 nxt model in camera 13 pxl Vera level but I got new  Samsung galaxy m33 rear camera 50 pxl better not fine
Battery back up was good.25W Fast charging was superb with super fasf travel adapter unfortunately it was not provided by the company.Camara was up to the mark, additional functions was good
Photos are not natural and saturatedBattery life is great with fast charging
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G waste battery life and camera is average
Product is good. Some are giving it a one star rating just because  they didn't  receive adopter in it. That's  their mistake.  They have to look at the details before ordering.
Good mobile at a reasonable price, but no screen guard, phone case, or adaptor is provided.This costed me 500rs more to buy some locally made non-branded accessories.
Battery backup very good, camera is good
Good product
I like it
All thing seems ok but phone has heating  issue and my previous  realme was better in battery performance.Touch screen  is excellent. Speaker is exceptionally good.
Good phone from samsung with few cons.Display is good.Battery excellent.Performance good for average gamers.Camera is not upto the level.My Call voice is totally mute for callers in some scenario.Overall a ok phone.
Battery life, Camera is fine but speed is not good screen jammed if you use after some time why I don't know its too late for me to replace it
Display is definitely its weak point. Some other brands have AMOLED screen in this price range.Touch screen sensitivity seems less as there is a lag between touching the screen and the response.General feedback from many is that Samsung M series is generally problematic, and so is my experience.
The gadget is nice, three draw backs observed1. No adapter with phone provided2. Front cam clarity not upto the mark3. Back cam not upto fhe markRemaining features are ok
Good budget mobile phone under 15000. Only issue is it should have sAmoled screen and charging adaptor at this price.
Runs smoothly.
The overall product is good the only issu is  that charger do not came in box... samsung should stop copying apple and start giving changer atleast in midrange phone
This phone does not have the required processing power to manage even the basic tasks like browsing and social media, forget gaming. Screen stutters, apps taking upto 5 seconds to show the content.
it is new. Camera quality is not so great. Good thing is the price of this product.
Charging adaptor not given for box how to charging for the mobile
Issue face on TouchPad
Best 5g mobile in this price range
Like good offer is super good
Very budgeted phone with brand. Value for money
It's good
If you are buying this get carry to carry 250 grms in hand. Battery life is very good and camera is okay and performance is good. Some lag in performance.
Good value for money
Worst phone to spend 15K.It don't have basic features that available in 7-9K phone.Don't buy if you want to buy phone heavy usage.Battery back is only best think I love, it last upto 48hrs normal browsing and youtube.Sometimes sticks,
Good phone at very good price. Thanks to amazon great Indian festival. Quality of battery & camera is very good. Good experience in communication apps (teams, WhatsApp)
Very good product.I like very much
Good phone
Not a value for money product
Heavy weight. Camera in video mode is useless.
Good to use
If you want to buy under 20k. This is the best.
All are good. but,weight of the devise is highapps lock not avaliable
Best phone ever with 6000 mAh battery but with an small update camera can be more better in color quality
VERY GOOD PRODUCT
I like  Samsung  brand.
Just loved it
I like about this product is battery, I use this product for my work purpose..
Nice phone
Very good product I am really enjoyed this Galaxy M33 5G
Everything is up to date just leaving the travelling adapter
Mobile is some what ok but finger print option on power is not good.
Nice phone with awesome battery. Negative point is that the charger is not included with the phone, you have to purchase it separately.
I am facing battery challenge..6000mah is a good battery capacity. But I can see the battery draining out fast with minimum call and browsing. I am not sure if my set is having battery defect or there is problem with this model.I bought this phone assuming the high battery life. Now can I return this product and get something new
I am using it for last three days, the main purpose of purchasing this product was playing Call of Duty in this.I thought it has 6000 mah battery so it will give me more than one day backup. but it is working like 4000 mah battery. And as most of us know, for which Samsung is famous, it is getting HANG while playing Call of Duty.
Camera is not good as expected
Satisfactory
The phone is responsive and good looking. The  only downfall is no charging socket in the box. Samsung should add it.
If you are very much fond of selfies, then go for premium segments it's nice however could have been better, rear camera is pretty decent does it's job well, I liked it when took in different shades. Other user experience is seamless and I don't see any flaws, battery performance is not bad, voice clarity, music, phone calls, accessibility are awesome. Moreover durability of Samsung is far ahead compared to recent players entered, overall worth buying.
Samsung
Battery and camera is good
Everything is ok but the camera quality is not much better
Very good
Good camera, processor and design a little off but TFT display not an issue. Batter charging takes long but lasts long.
After using 3 weeks phone is working fine.
Battery life is only bit diappointing coz it decreases very fast. Overall m33 is a good phone
Very nice 👌👌👌
Very Nice Phone just go for it
Product is not good
प्रदर्शन की गुणवत्ता बहुत खराब
The features and quality of camera and sensors are very good.Totally worthy


                    The media could not be loaded.


 Face lock bad battery  condition normal over all ok display lcd not good
Charger is a great minus and camera quality is not much clear volume is good
The phone seems to be working so far
I bought it for 13750/- with no cost EMIIt is worthy for this price.If price is higher, better to go for any other option.
Good. Bought for active voice feature. Cam is good. Charger will have to buy separately.
Pros:Overall phone is good.Battery backup is decent, charging is also fast.Performance is good.Cons:Its a bit heavy in comparison to other phones.Back side is slipery to hold.
Good
Weight and size only big, remaining all are good.
This is good value for money phone, not best but under 20000 its the best you can get.Display is very good,Battery is very good,Performance is also very good,This is Much better then Mi ,xiomi, realme chinese phones.Security and safety of data is good no advertising on this phone.Under 20000 this is the best right now. Or increase ur budget and buy M53.
Good product.  Finger print sensors not good
Finger print and gaming over heat,otherwise ok
I am totally upset with the face lock and finger print which are not working.
Very good
Good
I have looking only one things is batter it's only battery backup
Battery life is very good
My phone....like it
As per price camera must have been better ,battery life if good. Overall Phone is below expectations.
Overall a budget phone. Processor is good enough android 12 and other specs are pretty decent . Camera quantity is good for normal user , battery life is insane. At first phone might seem laggy but it's because of the animation speed , slow it down from settings ( huge difference after turning off and turn off high contrast text too). Display is TFT but colour are sharp and attractive if it had amoled it would be unbeatable. Other things are good overall a very good mobile for a normal user 👍. Will last about 2-4 years easily without any physical damage.
Good product
Awesome
Fingerprint awasom, battery life also excelent minimum 2 days you can use it. Camera quality  good clarity.
The phone is just perfect , specifically the specifications are just top notch , all functions are working perfectly , overall phenomenal product
Good performance, average battery life, nice display but missing amoled, worst fingerprint sensor
Very good as working condition
Battery is very very good Performance
फ़ुल चार्ज किये 7 घंटे हुआ बैटरी नही टिकता है
Superb product at this price range, got it for 13k
Packing is not good and very poor quality for delivery costly item like mobile phone. Not acceptable
Nice product
1)Mujhe iss mobile ki display bohot achi lahi chahe tft display likha he pr ye lcd tft display he aur amoled display ki quality ki he2)iska looks bohot achha he ye dekhne me bohot acha he3)iski battery best he
Compare to Other Series this is Best
Very nice product
If Front Camera is your priority, kindly avoid this model. It has a 8MP front camera and in the current technology, it will feel like a VGA camera.Other aspects of the phone are good.Bright and Sharp Display. Good 120hz screen. Phone is smooth and fast.Back camera is decent. Sound quality is decent.
Over all the phone is good but the real reasons why I'm rating 3 stars are because of the phone heating issue, whenever I charge my phone it heats up and I feel like its going to explode and charging adapter not included.
Camera is not Upto mark. Else processor Speed and Battery are very Good.
The phone is working well till now. However I did not receive the quick start guide which was supposed to be in the box.
The product is ok for the price range , the only issue is no other accessories provide, seems like incomplete package
Before purchasing you should know there is no travel adapter (charger) and type-c charging cable...
Fingerprints scanner not available & battery backup is just like 3000mah backup.Camera quality is also very below of 50MP
Good -Phone has good battery backup.Touch sensitivity is good.Bad-Lags a lot.Network issues.The phone is heavy and too big.
I bought this phone in October 2022 whose sim tray was defective.  After that phone replacement happened with great difficulty.  It ran for 2 months and in December its jack broke down. No one is responsible for this problm Amazon or samsung care. I paid rupees 930 for this problm.
👌
I like it very much...
Customer has to compromise with buying this phone they should have to spent another 1000 rupise for buy charger.
I didnt expected the package from samsung Without charger & headphonesNow a days every companies provide AMOled panel, but here only LCD...
Very poor quality camera and displayPicture quality is bad .
u can buy it.
I wanted a Samsung Phone..Great Buying ..Not much famous but still a great choice..Only charger is not available..
Camera quality is very poor, if you good photo, pls don't buy this phone. And phone UI also not good.
Value for money
This phone is suitable to use Intunes company portal. It comes with 4 years of security update. Everything in this phone is super except camera quality and few features. I will give 7.5 out of 10 overall. Although if are looking for a budget phone for office use, simply go for it.
Good Budget phone in 6000 mah battery capacity segment .  Already labelled having no Charger and Ear phone . This is made in India.
Battery is good.camera is not worth.
If your budget is tight then defiantly you cab go for this. It's Samsung. Many are saying it is heating but it's OS takes time to set with the user. I did not go for IQOO or realms as the brand quality depends. If you are planing to buy IQOO or realme then pls consider this option by increasing budget. Although some features are missing but that doesn't matter as many of us don't use them daily. Getting updates for 5 years is what you want!
Excellent superb. Value for money.
Camera quality and battery life🔋 is very good
Awesome
Good performance, has good battery life which can last 30-40 hours with decent usage, including browsing, taking photos, video calls. What stands out is the fingerprint reader, it's quick. Charging takes almost 2 hours for a full recharge considering below 10% to 100%. Overall impressions is good and qualifies as a good midrange performance smartphone. It does not come with a charger/travel adapter and charging cable has both ends USB type C. Missing a good backcase as most of the third-party ones had an improper camera-hole cut.
Charger has not provided in to my new mobile handset. That is the major problem. And it's was 8 gb ram memory but sometimes mobile was heating during operating times.
I am dissatisfied with this product (Samsung M33). Battery is draining too fast with in the 7 days of purchase. That is 1% for 1 minute if is use wifi or mobile network. No use of charging. This mobile battery cannot be run morethan 10 hrs of use.
The touch is not good. It behave very weird.Fingerprint area is very weird. It's difficult to manage the power button as well as fingerprint area at the same place.It's not even a month has passed and having problems with calls. I have to make several calls to be able to talk on one call.
Cellular signal receiver poor
Nice product but charger not provided with phone that is minus point
One of the best phone in below 20k category and that also from house of Samsung. I am using this for a minth now. Screen size and display is good, camera quality is good as well. Only noticed lag in finger scanner for opening the phone which sometimes need 2-3 times scanning for unlocking. We'll review once again after 6 months for sake of our friends interested in this phone. But as of today very happy to purchase this phone.


                    The media could not be loaded.


 I loved the camera of this mobile, gorilla glass is so good, little disappointed with the performance, sometimes phone getting heat up ( when playing high resolution games)
Whatever I purchased from amezon  seriously I am totally satisfied but urgently I purchased this cellphone and lost my all trust from amezonThe product which I got it was defective and hopefully  within 7days I got result from this cellphoneOnly one thing guy's if you wanna go to purchase Samsung go with a S series either other one but don't go with m series
Awesome clarity. No hanging issue
Performance of the phone is satisfactory,product delivered to me perfectly as committed by Amazon.25W travel adaptor purchase speratly it's not appreciated.
Camera and Display are good enough. 6000mah battery stays charged for about about 2 days in general mode.Disappointed that the adapter is not included in the phone.
Samsung is the best
Its a good high performance phone at the given price. Though, I was disappointed by the camera and fingerprint sensor.
The phone is ok for daily usage battery is good, u have to buy charger separately which is annoying.. The back camera is ok.. Front camera could have been much better
Pros:Battery LifeAppealing DeviceScreenCons:CameraLack of mobile charger in the boxLack of Accessories in the box and availability of Accessories on Amazon
Good product. Fingerprint reader is fast. Two days battery backup for normal daily use. Fast charging is there. There is no heating issue. Impressive Design and Color. Network coverage is good. Only one sim support 5g at a time. Adapter is not provided in the box. No headset. It cost extra 3k from your pocket. Samsung need to provide adapter atleast. I am dissatisfied with not providing adapter. Overall its good 5g mobile for daily usage. Thanks to amazon and samsung.
Samsung Brand 5G budget phone and satisfied with all the features of this phone. Go for it.
5g
good product
No charger
all good
I was using Samsung M30s. 2019 October Great Indian sale I purchased that phone for Rs. 13000. 6GB+128, Almond display, 6000 MAh battery, 13MP front camera, with fast charging adapter and no heating issues.I'm totally disappointed with Samsung M33 5g purchase.1. If we use this phone 1 hour continuously, phone is heating.2. No travel adapter3. No Almond display4. Front camera 8MP only
This smartphone is fast & meets a lot of expectations of a generic user at quite a reasonable price. Most important feature is accuracy of SAMSUNG HEALTH. THANKS SAMSUNG!!!
How could i charge my phone if both sides came as same. No USB port.
Waiting for another 7000 mah samsung phone so i can finally upgrade my M51 which is still going strong...
Thou just few days to brought this product, so far found it's a nice phone !
Premium feel!Camrea: 👍Battery: 👍 👌Performance: 👍
Fantastic phone. Everything is of Flagship phone quality. Except video quality. Youtube lovers don't buy this phone.
Value for money
I only bought Samsung for this particular feature ie, Call recording without the second party not getting to know I am recording the call. After the Android 11 release, every other phone company using Google dialer has to mandatory announce the call recording is in progress to comply with the GDPR laws of Europe. Only Samsung makes their dialers and does not use Google dialers by default, so they somehow circumvent this issue.But they did half-assed work.WIFI calling is an essential feature in the new phones. The network inside the homes is terrible in cities due to tower shortages. But when you enable the WIFI calling, this phone does not record, not manually nor automatically. Never knew this problem existed; even my old Oppo A31(android 9) has this call recording feature even if the WIFI calling is enabled. All Samsung phones, including this one, do not work. The Samsung forums have people complaining about this issue for the past two years, and still, there is no workaround from Samsung.I did not know about this problem. Otherwise, I would not have gone with this phone.Another issue, as everyone complained, is the missing adapter. It looks like Samsung wants to fool Indians by selling phones without adapters. I got fooled. It is going to give a bad reputation to Samsung. How good is a phone without an adapter? It's like buying a car without wheels.The phone is super heavy. It's not suitable for people with weak hands and muscular issues. Good as a hands-on weapon.Even though call recording has a severe shortcoming, the quality is good. It can be used as an everyday working phone with sufficient memory and storage.
At this price it is the best option
Choice for this phone is because, I find Samsung phones are more durable than other brands. I had this as my overall experience. It also meets her needs. She gets a more faster phone. More space, internal ROM 6GB RAM. 5G network support. Wide camera view. Better front cam. Wide screen. 5nm Samsung processor. Gorilla glass protection. Modern BAR form. 6K mAH battery, 2 days of backup. Nice phone color. The 25w charger that I bought in addition is much faster. I am satisfied.
Mb sholde be with adopter
Very good product in this budget
Good looking phone in this price rangePros:Decent CameraFast ChargingFast ProcesserKNOX SecurityCons:Adapter isn't thereAMOLED Display isn't there
Received mobile set yesterday with charging cord only. The adapter has not been provided with it. Therefore charging is not possible. Pl. send the the adapter quickly.
It beats expectations in every department. A bit heavy , but then the battery life is good. Very sleek. Excellent camera and good sound system. WORTH EVERY RUPEE. Proud to use a Made in India phone
Nice
Lagging feels sometimes that's the  issue facing
It's a first class device, Tft screen but far better than many IPS Display, very crisp and laud mono speaker, smooth and good camera. Samsung is Samsung.
Battery life only one day,6000mh hone ke babjude or jada use bhi ni hai,screen shot ki wahi purana tarika volume or switch button se..
The phone is good. Exynos 1280 is okay enough, not blazing fast but gets the job done. Rear camera is quite good in daylight. The display, though TFT is okay - as long as you don't compare with an amoled side by side you won't even notice its a PLS TFT. Sound is a little low through the speaker. Sound on earphones is good. As mentioned in the description, this does not come with a charging brick, which is okay. Most of us may have some charger at home lying around.

 Well performance was excellent working in every platform and way..I would like to gave you very positive feedback  thank you I can say to amazon
Finger print sensor which is alloted in power button
Good & great phone in range
Using phone from last 5 days.very nice phone.camera good,charging good,very stylish phone. Don't trust fake reviews.type c _ type c cable given because it supports reverse charging( using this phone tou can charge other mobiles).adopter need to buy(1000).buy this mobile unless you are very free( not doing any work and always playing games)
Everything is fine but if they add adaptor for charging it's ultimate good for that budget
We can get mobiles with additional features for the same cost,price is high
Go for it long term performance is good than mi.... only dissatisfaction is adapter.... not expect from such good brand
I like it 👌Absolutely this phone is really too good 👍
Overall best phone in the budget thanks amazon
Camera is to clean and better
excellent performance..like camera quality 👌 I am purchase 13500 with my sbi card extra discount applicable 2500...thank you amazon team
Good phone but you have to take charger separately and also at the price segment other company's are providing charger and also amoled display but here there is nothing like that but if they had taken something the they have to give something so for that they had given good processor in this phone and also reverse charging feature also.
But No charger given 25W original charger Cost 1700rs. Disappointed
I bought this phone on 14 April and writing this review after 8 days usage. The performance of phone is somewhat one can expect in a budget of 20000. It gives you an immersive experience in gaming. Not a single drop of fps is seen. Camera quality is way better than i expected. And the battery pack is itself good that the phone work for 2 days on a single charge. My overall experience with m33 5g is good and expect to be more better.
Slow response, not shows dailer details immediately when you get a call or when you dail in. Also camera quality is average not much great as mentioned in features. Overall average phone
Really best mobile
I like this phone
All over phone is goodRating 4.5 out of 5
Need to increase the quality
Limited or bothersome options like screen shots etc...also have to Tap no of times .Today in over a month time Recharging problem , have to visit Samsung service center in New city for me at Dehradun
Battery Capacity and Backup in very good as 6000 MAh.This is heavy Phone, Camera is Average but not up to mark.
All over is excellent
Nice product. Finger print reader in side is not convenient to use. Also trouble in sensing every time. Processor seems to be slow. Little bit lagging in functions
Good Phone
Satisfied with overall quality.
Good in looks and performance and camera too


                    The media could not be loaded.


 Using for 3 weeks and phone is working well without issues. The switch from my old samsung phone was smooth - it took 2 hours or so and all the apps and data were in place. Camera is decent, battery life is very good.
Good
Nice phone
Not bad ....
I had liked it too
Display panel is TFT, it is 120 hertz (Adaptive - switch between 60 or 120), but quality is not like sampled.It is down grade to my previous phone m30sBrightness is higher than old but panel is not upgrade or even same
Price
Good phone, battery backup is good, best phone at this price.
call waiting funtion not working ,Calling screen disapears ,Mobile hangs,Heavy ,All new different settings
Actually I need more battery backup it's not there and need to get fast charging it's not there what I expected it's not there in samsung33 so it's not updated version of samsung  and it's get charging late consume battery power faster, i thing updated only 4g to 5g remaining all same.
Phone is good in midrange devices and providing affordable 5G with Samsung inhouse exynos processor.Pros:Battery life120Hz refresh rate display5G supportDedicated SD card slotCons:TFT displayCharging timeNo charging brickBulkyThe main drawbacks of the device are the plastic back, TFT display and slow charging. The main strengths of the device include the battery life, Samsung’s good after-sales and software update guarantee topped with decent performance.
Nice phone from sumsung
A really good smart phone with decent display and 2 day battery life (normal use). The camera can do wonders with the right lighting. The only flaw I observed was, mild heating at the time of charging. 120Hz is noticeable and makes the interaction butter smooth. I also love the fact that I can add a SD card with 2 sims since the phone doesn't come with a hybrid slot. Overall I would say this phone is balanced and would recommend buying.
Na
All is gud but it take more then usual for charging and front camera is too bad and the most imp thing that its battery backup is awesome
Finger print, battery life, camera
Processor is not upto the expectations. Mediocre device at that Price.. With brand name, created hype in the market, encashed with high price from early customers. We have better options in the market. Be vigilante with samsung marketing tactics..
All day enjoyed
Highly recommended
In this price range good phone exp !!no charger
Phone has great features but looks like to make the product price competitive, Samsung simply removed the charger head. I could had avoided my purchase had I observed carefully what is there in the box. On top of that, in order to cash on over fished customers, Samsung simply provided a cable which is Cat C head at both end so that the hapless customer cannot make use of other available USB chargers. Pathetic marketing. Apart from this I also observed that there is no screen guard pre applied to screen and now have to shelve out additional bucks for that too.Earlier I had Xiaomi, Lenovo and Realme phones and never saw such low kind of customer fishing approach.  Thought to try with Korean Giant this time but seems caught unaware with this low level cost saving tactics at the cost of unaware customers.  Phone is great but without the basic accessory and customer fishing marketing (of cat-c  cable head at both end) simply ruined my shopping experience.
Battery is good, little bit heat, camera zooming is good, camera pics is not bad and overall expects is good
Good phone but camera quality is not good.
Its okay this price for...
Till now have not seen any glitches, M33 5g works perfect.
Product is good but Samsung should provide Adaptor along with handset as whole set, it will help to sell the product as well 🙁
The bezel is too big.It looks like a 8k smartphone. There is no settings to reduce refresh rate. So the battery performance hit is very high and u can't control it. Camera is same as previous models. There is no charger in the box. Camera glass get scratches very easily. Cell reception is also very bad.
इस किंमत मे बढिया फोन

 Good camera n battery life
Product is not as per description and having display issue with small dot on the screen. I came to know it two days later after return window closed. So I am requesting to Amazon team to return or atleast replace the item.
It's a good phone under 17000, good battery, clear sound and decent cameras.
After days continuous use,,honestly saying..its  a good one..but they are not providing charger..eventhough its best
Good one
Video playback in prime and hotstar gets paused often and have to restart the mobile to get it  right
Good for me as I am having Samsung chargers already. good for students with low cost. configuration and performance wise good.
Ok
Phone gets slower after initial one month. M32 is much faster ass compared to M33
Samsung Mobile working and all very good. Ease to use. But both front and rear camera quality not upto our expectation. Has to improve camera
Camera quality  is not  good.  It is too bulky.
Its a good phone. Camera is okay not excellent. Also phone lags a bit
Perfect
Considering its price and various facilities available in this Samsung mobile phone, I like it very much.
After Using if for 15 days, I can recommend buyers to go for it
Samsung galaxy is very good phone
Great
Using galaxy m33 5g for the last three months battery is good,  fingerprint is also good, camera should be better, lags a bit after few days of using
Been using this phone for 3 days and it is absolutely flawless. The battery backup is very good inspite have a 120hz panel. Don't worry about the tft display. I was previously using a phone with amoled display and I find no drawbacks in this display it's same. The user experience of Samsung's OneUI 4 is quite good. The camera is upto the mark and have many features. The processor is good and the extra virtual ram is a win win. The only issue is that it doesn't come with a charger (adapter).
The problem is that it is a slow phone
Good
Not good to buy very slow while making call and phone gets hang frequently
Light weight,decent battery,photos are great,overall quality is excellent
Super phone super fast.....I like it.  Typing speed is very fast.  .....
Clear sond.. decent picture.. good Bluetooth connectivity..But no charger with this pack.
This phone is amazing.  The features are good. Even the battery life is also good, but it misses out AMOLED display.
The phone does not come with a charger which is the most stupid thing ever. You are expected to give a charger when you buy a new phone. Data cable is of no use without a proper adapter. Bad move Samsung!
Those who think about TFT display as the negative side of this phone can ignore it. I could'nt find any difference on using. Far better displays of other brands IPS screens. 5G phone with a decent price, go for M33 or F23. I love amazon service, hence I ordered M33. Thank you Amazon for your best service like always.
Best mobile in this price with lot of facilities. 8 gb 128 gb 6000 mah
Phone heats up frequently
Good Product at this price
In Airtel portal this handset is in the list of 5G but while running test it fail.
Don't go to buty this one , heating hanging problem and samsung M series not support by Knox security .
Good camera resolution quality, very good battery, 5G Technology in affordable price range.
Phone hanged whenever I connect to a bluetooth, Whenever I call or disconnect a call. phone become unresponsive for few seconds. It is downgrade from M30s . I was using m30s . m30s developed screen issue with time. This phone also have the unstable Touch and Fingerprint reader.When you are typing if your hand touches fingerprint reader, it will trigger that action.  (Unintelligent algorithms)When I am typing. Screen capture random touches(character) which I not ever pressed. Again (Unintelligent algorithms )
The camera and battery plus gorilla glass protection is why I bought the phone but the back cover cracked on the first fall. Not at all sturdy which is a lil disappointing at this price point. Otherwise it's a pretty much decent phone does the job well.

 Mobile phone recieve but charger not availableOnly data cable recive both side c type how can charge mobile
Pros- decent phone with 5g in this price range...no Chinese touch...Cons - no wow feature;  heavier phone; pathetic finger print scanner and it's position. Camera is not that good ....If you want no Chinese phone with 5g, go 4 it.
Good product in this range..
The phone is good but there is no charger with the phone. How come the customer is supposed to charge the phone ? Its really very pathetic to see that the companies are now a days impying such lowly cost cutting ways. I could have easily given 5 star but just because of no charger 2 stars are deducted.
Average phone

Hi Guys,When I opened the front camera it’s getting failed I have attached the screen shot also.This is really bad as I just purchased this mobile one week back.No physical damage though.Amazon declined to return this mobile.
Nice, touch. Audio, Vedic quality good
Battery backup very goodCamera quality is A1Look or appearance of phone is also goodThe only disadvantage that the company is not providing adapterOtherwise this is the perfect phone under this price range
I like very much.
Upgrade front camera quality
Fast charger missing at this price point. Rest phone is too new to comment as of now.
Superb Mobile
Hello teamWe are expecting adaptor too with box and due to this I moved to another brand.You are old players so do not loose your customers😎
Battery is very very good , some really cool features
Camera quality not good, even in Rs 5000 you will get better camera.Phone is fast but no charger provided.Heavy phone and battery life is not good.Buy screen protector also with phone if you are buying this waste phone.
Product is bulky
एक अच्छा फोन
Good
Good
Post a couple of updates from Samsung, whatsapp call, the other end doesn't hear our voice. Even after reinstalling whatsapp it doesn't work.
Nice picture
Mobile is good,  battery 🔋 performance is also good.  But company should provide charger with device.  Rs. 16000 is enough for this device with charger. Please think twice while purchasing this Mobile 📱 🙏....
बॅटरी इसकी बढिया नाही हे
Front camera Quality low
Cheated me with a poor quality product packaged in Samsung Brand with a wrapper of miscommunicated features. Just 3 reasons not to buy this -1. Pathetic camera quality2. Horrible connectivity of Wifi and Network3. Awful speakers and sound quality4. After taking so much money, this cheater company wants u to buy a Rs 1300 C type chargerAbove all there is no exchange of this garbage.
Camera quality is nice. Only drawback is charger is not available.
All the features are disliked
Good camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG.Pros5nm Octa-core processor, 6000mAH battery, 120Hz Refresh rate, Dedicated SD Card Slot, 5G Bandsfeatures like a screen recorder, video call effects, Game Launcher, Link to Windows, Dual Messenger, Quick Share, Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others. Some of the fancy Android 12 features.CONSNo Charger in the boxyou wanted to buy a Samsung smartphone then you should consider the Galaxy M33 5G.
excellent item for these price 15000 rs
Will never buy a Samsung phone again....if i have to purchase an extra charger might add well will not buy the phone
Good phone under 20000
I am using it from last 2 month’s, I don’t see any issues other than little weight when compared to other models. U can take it if you’re budget is not more than 16k
Excellent Phone!
Camera average. Finger scanner glitch. Battery is bosssss. Heats up some time. Over weight. Keypad is so tiny words to type. Because of fast network consumes data too much when on youtube.
Nothing to say! Just like a normal 4G mobile with good battery life.
I have a cooking channel in You Tube.I used this product for video recording
Working Good
Good partLoved the first look...Fast processorBattery ..Camera inbuilt functions for picture processingScreen sizeCost is great for 8 gb ram namaste 50 mp cameraBadIt's packagingCharger cable only no charger
Amazing battery, overall performance is good
The phone has an excellent battery life and processor but the trade off is the display. Doesn't feel like a Samsung display!
Music lovers beware, this mobile does not support Stereo Sound
Display must improved
I had a M20 before.  I liked that more. Reasons:1. Side fingerprint reader not convenient.2. Whilst charging phone heats up3. Size bigger so juts out of shirt pocket4. Heavier and bulky as compared to M20I have used for just 2 weeks yet
Humble request dont buy this product 100% Waste modal
Vvvgood
Display resolution is not up to the mark
good phone with this price
Battery backup not good. Approx 40 percent battery drained on 5 hours in normal calling and Phone is wifi. No game no video only calling approx 40 minutes. 50 mp camera does not support zoom function. No charger in the box by company. No screen guard, no backcover. Think before buying. Thanks
No charger, no back cover, no tamper glass, no earphone.
Nice phone.but over heating and camera is some low clarity. Over all good phone
it has sync issue and perform bit slower response like typing or sync any other app.


                    The media could not be loaded.


 Good build quality,  good software,Bulky in weight,  average gaming experience.Battery works for nearly 30 hrs with routine work with full charging
Like all features,Dislike is heavy to carry
Camera quality is not good
Heavy, very heavy, my wrist pains now.Very thick. Seems like 2 phonesReflective screen, struggle in daylight. Slow even when 8 GB RAM.Call voice is good.
Very sleek and stylish. Camera quality is good. Finger print sensor is good.
Heating problem aa rhi h video calling mai.
Samnung doesnt provide charger.  The charger cost extra 1500Also the cable is C to C , which cant be used to all power banks.Camera quality is real poor. I was using a nokia with 16 MP which was way better.
Very Good Phone by Samsung. All features are Good. I have been purchased this phone of Rs. 14,250 with Great Discount from Amazon. Recommend to everyone to buy this Samsung Phone without read other Negative Reviews. Thanks.
👍👍
I like the finger print system, it opens easily and quickly, battery life is quite good unfortunately camera is not yet tested.
Specially  those people  are using MI and Realme ,poco phones  earlier they might be get in trouble after using this display.Software experience  amazing . Camera is better than chinese phones ...
Camera and battery backup very good. OS very user friendly. Overall a good buy
Battery and fingerprint sensor superb.
Due to lack of company adopter.
Like only battery but phone hang some time and pick not good.
Cable missing
I made purchase then noticed 2k less on Samsung website. Anyway it’s my mistake so not returning it. Hope this will be fast one as it’s 6gb ram.After couple of days usage i am feeling bad on this purcgase. 6GB ram but i am not happy with speed of this. Skype too slow.4 cameras but its useless for taking photos of real use. If you just want to share it on social media then it looks awesome. But if i want to take a product photo and try to edit in photoshop its no where near to usable qualityAs its slow you definitely need tripod to get photos proper.Usage reviewIt's the worst phone i ever used and 6gb or 8gb ram is just a trap. It's useless as this phone is dead slow. If I click something i get something else. That kind of slow it is. Chinese brands with 2gb ram and below 8k budget got 100x speed  than this. To type this review it took me lot of time becaus it's issues.
No new features and heavy in carrying
Wheght
Front camera is not so good and the speakers too but processor and display is quite good
This product is excellent.
Thx to Samsung and Amazon for real offer , I like phone very much, remember I don't use phone for gamming so for personal and office purpose phone is gem.bonus foe me: Jio i am using as 5G sim (5G/LTE/.....) and getting download upto 46MB (it was ~18MB on my old 4G phone), not sure about reason but I am recovering the phone cost :)
Excellent
Nice
The battery quality was really good.. A charge a day is nearly enought.. camera quality was really good for this price.. camera has quite a number of features
Good budget price mobile
Good
the display leaves much to be desired.
No chargerNot charging quickly even using 25 watts samsung company charger. Need maximum 1:30 hour to charge 100%Camera selfie is averageLitely hanging when making calls
The phone is working as desired, no issues with battery over heating, I can limit battery charging to 85% which lasts for one day. The camera has good quality, the photos were wonderful in my recent trip. No lag in the phone and future ready with 5G. The fingerprint working flawlessly.Made in India phone.
Weight more to previous mobile
Liked it... Its under middle class budget
battery life is not good rest is good.
Worst screen sensing ability. Finger sensor should be on the screen.  Battery is ok
Recommended for house wives and mothers who use phone moderately (i mean, this phone is not good for heavy users).Reason for 2 star rating is that they didn't provide a charger and with the charger which i got separately outside, I'm facing slow charging speed and heating issues. Mobile company giants like samsung and apple are not providing chargers in the name of becoming ECO FRIENDLY, but doing this only adds to carbon footprint by these :1]new charger means new cover and new box for that charger2] additional new box and packaging material for shipping (@ online orders)3] additional fuel consumption by vehicles transporting the charger4]additional invoice means additional paper5] if the received piece is defective or not upto the mark, returns and replacements add more to all these.THIS BETTER STOP NOW.this new trend is as annoying as it's impracticality.If not for their charger feud, i would've given this 4-5 stars.PS: display is a drawback for this mobile but in the long run, you wouldn't notice any difference. So, i guess LCD display isn't much of a problem.
3star ..for 4 star or more ...Should have most important is dust and water proof 2. Amoled screen 3. 25 w charger inside box to have authentic charger. I would have paid more 3000 to 5000 with all this features and given 4 Star ++
Not satisfactory!1. It seem side panel is made with old used material.. Lots of scratches on side panel.2.  Though 5nm processor and 6000mAh battery, still battery draining fast .3. Display quality is not good enough. TFT display. In this price you will get Amoled display in other brands4. Performance not bad.5. 120hz refresh rate working very smoothly.6. Voice focus working smoothly.Giving 2 star rating because of the side panel made of used material with lots of scratches. Otherwise I would give 3 star rating.I will never buy a Samsung device again in mid segment.
I haven't put it into operation yet. Waiting for the right moment.
At this price range there are plenty of options but I wanted a Samsung phone, because my previous phone was a Samsung too (J7 2015 Model)  which lasted for more than 6 years without any problem.I Bought it for 14249/-  + Charger,Battery lasts for a day easily, Good Camera,Display is awesome.Its an amazing phone at this price range if you are looking for a Samsung phone.
Totally satisfied
Samsung M33 5G, side placement of  finger print sensor is  such a  stupid design flaw that  it  keep on  locking  screen and you have to use PIN each time.  6000 mAH battery  makes  phone  heavy weight and you have  to grab the  phone exactly on finger print sensor.  This  defective  design  is  making  quite disappointing  experience.  Do note that  the  phone does  not  get  return/refund  as  this  design  issue is  not  considered  as  defect.  Do check  this  issue  before  buying  and putting  your  hard earn money as  both Amezon and Seller  do not  respond  to your  query.
Phone is getting hung frequently when receiving calls. Not able to pickup calls
It is very good
Its nice experience, battery life is good, touch is good, processor is fast, camera quality is good specially macro mode is very effective for me, I am uploading one macro shot taken by this phone, I am satisfied with the result, delivery was really super fast, on the very next day I have received my phone, overall I have nice experience with Amazon as well as Samsung M33.
Most of people here complaining about not giving adapter but this phone is nearly as premium  smartphone so stop complaining about it ... I'm fully satisfied with this smartphone most of you are poor ... LOL adapter  is just 1000rs don't be a bitch buy it
Phone is superb, nice pictures quality, good battery life and also camera is good 👍
All is outstanding! It have all latest features such as One UI 4.1 which is based on Android 12 which usually comes in Samsung flagship phones. This combination gives an immersive experience to the user.But there are little two problems1. Camera setup is all good but selfie camera gives you little blurry image and macro lens is not at all good.2. In this price segment, must there be a charger adapter or a cover with phone.
Quality is good buy weight is too high. Gripping is uncomfortable. Some times apps are hanging.
Nice phone
The seller should avoid mails/texts that the item has been delivered while the fact was it was still two days away! That created avoidable confusion and unnecessary exchange of words with Amazon customercare executives.Otherwise I am happy with the product. And Made in India, to boot!
I have not received USB cable
Good Product.
I was looking for a phone in the 15K category and shortlisted Nokia G21, Moto G52 & Samsung M33. After a thorough comparison we decided to settle for M33 for the following reasons1. higher resolution & better display2. bigger battery capacity3. Android 12 out of the box and guaranteed updatesThe phone is a value for money buy and I hope it will live upto the standard
No charger is disappointed
Common complain adapter not providedC type common both the ends of cable
It's a reasonably good phone with lot of packed up features,  go for it
The performance of this phone is as expected.The only drawback is, it's region locked.
Good one
Camera Quality is not good. Adaptor is not provided. product is over price.Samsung is charging for brand value from the customer however the product quality is not improving. Although its a era of competitive environment.
An amazin phone includin all the latest astonishing features within 20k. Its an stupefying phone to have. The experience alone is so smooth and techsavy yet so simple and symbloic!
Good
Very good product I am using 👌 🙂
Good quality
Best phone under this range
Like the product but it would be good if we add charger and phone case.
Many issues like heating ,battery backup etc.But bcz of build quality i recommended it.
Very good mobile
Thanks amezone
Iam facing mother board problem
Battery good
Battery is goodFingerprint is goodCamera is ok , could have been betterProcessor is slow and major minus for me and I will surely ready to sell this phone at loss...to buy another fast phone in coming days..

 Loved the color and looks of the phone.  The charger is not provided which can cost u extra money.  I missed reading about the contents in the box.Rest all features are good. Samsung is as usuall having nice hardware and good operating structure.  All 6 mobiles in my home are samsung only.Should have provided with the charger to be more worthy at the price. 15999 is the price which was worth buying, hope price drops are not scary.
Battery and tuch screen  is best 👌
Mobile is worth the price. Only drawback one you unlock the phone it takes couple of secs to refresh the screen for time update and show notification. But overall satisfied
Battery is great.. but touch and screen is so so..
Good Working and Best Features
YOU SHOULD PROVIDE CHARGER ADOPTER ALSO

 No issues
Display is not good
It is nice
Almoded scree not givenTft screen  heatting
Fingerprint not working very well.
Good deal..But we can purchase adopter separately in rs 1500....
I purchased the product through Amazon and it has been a great experience ever since. I would recommend this product for 2 reasons. First : it is definitely value for money and provides great performance which is a benchmark set by Samsung.Second: support Samsung as it is investing in developing the Indian economy unlike other Chinese companies that are making huge profits to take it to China.
Good Battery Backup. Display Good. Network Aggregation Good. Love u 💓 Samsung.
Not providing adapter makes most of the customers unhappy, just like me.
Good phone
They are not providing any accessories to the mobile and box is too small
I like it
Gets hanged frequently,don't buy it.
It's just how i expected the phone to be. Its really nice and the colour is very beautiful, also the screen the body everything is strong,not to forget the camera quality it's just great (no need for iPhone if Samsung brings just perfect camera qualities 😏) TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY
You are right phone
Good phone
Must include free charger adapter. Otherwise Samsung has to provide battery back up for the warranty period. Don't make fool the customers in the name of fake nature love

 Just Go for it !!! Completely Satisfied.
I LIKE IT 🙂
Over all very nice phone, good performance and no problems. But two trade off, first due to large battery thickness is more and unlike M58 or A-series security chip is not there.
I like the product
Good

Good quality product
Even having 8 GB RAM, the phone gets hung.Slow recognition of fingerprint reader.The camera is also slow. If you click a picture, you can see the previewer in 2-3 secs.Not worth buying this in 19k.
For google maps and internet related.
The phone is good but the outer package was open.
Good phone
Sometime Finger print is  not working worst product
Value for money.
I love this phone. It is within budget with so many features. The packaging and delivery were also good.
Totally very nice
Dislike: signal problems with mobile.
A little bulky but excellent on every other aspect.
Liked thickness, battery backup,camara clarity and devise features
Not in the expected level
Product is nice... they could have provided charging adapter as well...
Lacking in features when compared with Redmi. Eg. Camera, alarms, Do not disturb.My first Samsung phone and also the last.
Camera not good...others properties are good..
Value for money
This phone  is very  good  & looking dashing...
Upgraded from m31 to m33.Just loving it.Ultra smooth as butter and responsive.For some reason doesn't feel heavy as I expected.Very happy with it. Display is just fine even though supposedly not sAmoled.Bought 25W charger as it was in  discount as a bundled offer.I chose due to latest 1280 5nm processor and Android 12 out of the box with assured upgrades to Android 13 when available.Will update over next few days.
Water drop notch in 2022 doesn't justify😇
Overall Mobile is good but some hitting issue. Camera quality is good.
Awesome product
Amoled screen would have been good.
In this price this phone is best
Amazing phone in amazon. It is having more specifications for reasonable price.But only C type cable is available in the box. Adopter for charging & USB to connect laptop should be buy it seperately.
just heating problem..watching videos make it worse..
Best mobile from Samsung in this price segment
God
Very beautiful and very real
This is simply great mobile for usses
Lasting battery life, good software optimization
Pros:1200 Exynos processor which is the same processor as in A53.Camera and battery good comparitevely with other phones in this price range.Cons:TFT display.No charger adapter,Many bugs in UI, restart is needed to work normally esp with videos.
Charging adapter nahi Hai or fingerprint screen Mai nahi hai
Mobile camera quality below status. Also back plastic cover gets scratchs without roughly handling. Below expected only good thing is battery which you have to brought good charger from extra money.😖
This phone has average camera quality, the display is very poor, even the lenovo k8 note (my previous) phone was better in display, not happy
Good phone bahot accha prodact

Super
A very nice quality piece if device what Samsung has created and I would suggest you to buy this product. But Amazon packing was not good and outer packing was damaged and torn.
Only concern for LCD display.
Product performance is moderate, lot of cost cutting by Samsung over built of phone is average screen get scratch while using in moderate usage. I recommend to go for higher version of Samsung phones
Good phone overall
Using It For Almost A Month. Not at all buggy like xiomi or realme. Clean UI, Works Great. I don't know why this product has so many bad reviews. I have redmi note 10T 5G but is is verry buggy & built quality is cheap.
Charging cable  or Charging adapter missing
Bettry back-up is not good
Camera , screen  quality better
Don't buy this phoneTotally Waste of moneyBattery life is very very poor qualityCamera quality is not good
Face Unlock is Pathetic, Finger Print sensor is very small, Battery is Good, Overall good phone in this Price Range
Everything is good about the phone except display. Its a LCD display and not super AMOLED display. I was using M30s earlier which had super amoled dispaly and i had purchased it around 16k. I spent around 20k on M33 but display quality  is very basic.If you are using amoled display phone currently and switch to this phone you will hate it.
Everything is well and good, but the battery is not taking 100%, it's getting charge  up to 80% .
Good 👍
Battery life looks good but camera quality ok since it's blurred when same zoom .Screen quality also good but sometime it get stuck .They way it is advertise it looks great phone but overall looks ok phone
I love samsung mobile
Finger print reader is too large on the side. One has to cover the entire area for the print to be read correctly. Other functions are ok as of now
Good battery life overall good
good battery and camera
Value for money
Speed is reallly a concern, unreasonably underperforming device, mi is way behter.
Battery life and camera quality
Adapter and headset need to be provided from company
Bad display quality, 2160p video streaming isn't working, RAM consumed by by device apps is more, Exynos processor is bad
I like it very much. Delivered on time with proper package. Mobile looks good.
No problem yet after used of months and product quality is very good.i am happy with it
Stpl sold me used pruduct ,it hapoensed twice with me.For two month passed but i couldnt use till now but follow continue
Samsung M33 is worth for your penny! Budget price comes with amazing features! Good camera quality.  Battery life stand hardly one and half day buy with superpower charger we can charge quick. Display is overall good. Ouput Sound in speaker samsung has nailed it.Quality of sound can hear everymusic note. Looking for a budget and superb mobile go for it.
The phone came to me with a defective data cable where both ends have been fixed with C type connector. Can you explain how to use it??
Pros :Screen sizeAndroid 12 out of the boxThe green back color looks fabulousCons:Adaptor not includedCostlyTFT display=========Battery life is okCamera is ok
Can't say a budget phone but what's this data cable, C type on both ends, unusable. Getting heated up so soon.  Won't recommend.
Camera quality is good
Handy and good looks
Feeling nice as is product of latest specifications in bit lower price.
Lags when you are putting too much load on it. so decide for yourself, everything else is good enough.
Average quality with worst battery backup
There is no charger .what is the use of 2 side c port .poor poor delivery . ordered one day delivery option but I got mobile after 3 days
No charger head supplied. Cable wrong type with both ends similar. Doesn't fit with old charger head.
Display is low res or not clear like other mobile who come in low budget. No charging adaptor provided. Like low budget phone with big screen and high storage. Ram also vertual. Not like...My recent previous mobile galaxy M32 is class one.
Battery is not up to the mark.
i am happy this product.
Battery life is good. Front camera is very bad quality .within a few mins use phone gets too much heat like an iron.
I have 8 gb ram model and I am using it for quit past two months....but it doesn't live upto the expectations....it lags badly when I try to open any pdf file...camera is also slow. refresh rate some times look like 60hrtz.
Loved the phone, fingerprint and camera quality is too good
Hello AmazonPls change my phone because it's a defective phonePls do needful
Extremely satisfied
very good phone after a long time from Samsung after galaxy S duos i found this a very big hit and value for money there is no complaints about the features of this phone i used for a month and more and i didnt face any problems  overall its a very good phone to Buy in this budget
Not good as it is heating a lot
I was exited that M33 5G phone is improvised to M32 5G but it turned out be false it is TFT LCD screen and doesn't have dual speaker. Hence the sound quality and screen quality is not worth.Want to return or exchange
Good phone for good discount.
Gaming not good full hang,
Poor camera, wrong review by gadget  gurus...better to buy  mi or one plus
Hanging

Allmost good
Phone is good but disappointing that doesn’t charger in not included in box. Most of smartphones comes with fast charger. Type c cable is provided.Phone is FHD not with samloed screen.Cost cutting from Samsung, Need to improve as per consumer need.
Good
Nice product and good quality 👍
The phone is ok for normal use .  i am getting battery back up form 7am to 9pm . while zoom call phone heat pretty high and battery goes down from 50%-10% in a hour.  Day with out zoom call i will get backup 7am to 11:59 pm. as for now i am using 50% storage and not felt any lag on using it. yea opening camera app there it lag a bit.  . also found a lag in switching  data  between networks. normal user its pretty good . daily heavy office use not recommended.
Good
xcellent phone
super
Best  phone  use for all purpose
When I use mobile is heating
Very very slow.Even after turning off notifications,it comes and continue to stay on the screen for about 60secs or more.
Iam so happy very nice phone.camera is very clarity.
Review comments-No charger in kitSlight heating issueHangs frequentlyYou can't open wifi and Hotspot same timeCamera is good
Battery is very good
1) Charger not provide very very disappointing 2) Battery performance very poor.3) video quality not goodOver All performance not up to mark.
Is phone ka battery  backup kafi Jada Hai
Good camara clarityGood lookFingerprint reader amezingGood for normal useWon't be good for gamers
Its a mid range mobile and it costs around 18000 but still they didn’t provide the charger and also the performance is also not good.It would be better to go with xiomi
Very good quality product 😊
Intially I was using redmi note8. I can say from experience that redmi note 8 phone was way more faster than this phone.Display is also not justifying price.
(P. S:Photos taken on Samsung NOTE10) .First impression, software is good, battery is better and a good amount of RAM and storage. Cost cutting on Charger adapter and AMOLED screen disappointed a lot, I felt could have been little bit slim
I am writing this review after 2 month using the Samsung M33 mobile, full paisa vasool..... I gifted the mobile phone my husband, he is very happy with this...... Thank you team Amazon.....👌👍😊
Touch not fast
Good features,fast app loading and switching, smart view doesn't detect my Android tv. Also the screenshot taking. Is not easy. With two Button press, three finger or palm slide feature. Is missing.
1. Mobile is very smooth and slim.2. Processor is performing very good on live video game.3. Camera is very good.4. This mobile has virtual RAM support (you can add on RAM from internal memory upto 6 GB). This is very good in this system.5. Support super fast charging of 25W. Charge mobile quickly for normal use when you need to go outside suddenly.
ok ok mobile . too heavy and bulky.

 Not bad
Fingerprint little difficult to adjust..
Nothing is working in this phone. Suddenly it is not recognizing my sim cards. Not a single app is working, after 2 min of use, it says app is not responding. No video, no audio. And I don't have option even to return the phone.
Very good handset
Good to use and very responsive screen. No problem faced till now. Works well with no overheating issues. Fingerprint sensor works well. Camera quality is good and captures images with text in very good quality with even moderate light. Not yet tried all features, but seems a very good phone for normal usage, cannot expect more.
Good quality display, sound and body. Feels bit bulky by its design. Good battery backup. 120Hz refresh rate is really nice while scrolling te screen. Camera quality also very good.
No charger but c type cable also of C type from both end so no chance to use the exist charger. Samsung  unnecessary compelling to buy new charger, even no providing with this phone. Samsung is using very poor tactic so the mobile buyer must buy new charger.
As already declared, charger is not provided with the phone. Who are very particular about charger with phone, they need not buy it. Performance is very good. Battery is awesome. Can handle many applications at a time without lagging. Nothing new to run in the phone since all Samsung phones are having same interface. Camera is good and video quality is also very impressive. Worth buying it if you can afford charger separately.
Value for money
Poor quality in the case of lock mask app and dual app
Avoid Chinese brand do not buy from oppo,Xiaomi,vivo, one plus as it belongs to one Chinese company. They are funding direct Chinese military.But Nokia, lg, Samsung.No heating issue in the phone
Phone feels heavy compared to m30
Speaker quality is good
Camera quality is worst and phone is getting hanged. I have purchased the order yesterday only
Good product
Fabulous
Slightly heavy and Battery drain too fast.
Initially i have some doubt while perchasing this mobile seeing the negative comments and low rating give by some of customers . but after using this mobile really this mobile has more pros than cons. Pros :1.Great touch sensitivity 2.Good Battery Life 3. Good quality  cameraCons : Travel adopter not included
Overall performance is not good totally disappointed
Disappointed with Amazon, really a bad camera but you can't return and order new phone. They don't give any choice. This js really bad. It's waste of money . It's better to go to shop and buy because you can verify everything there as per choice.
Mobile is good but not outstanding. Display is also average. No Charger provided in package. It means extra for charger. Also, overall phone compared to price is not that satisfying. Will review after using 1-2 months.
good product
I like 👍
The best thing is this phone comes with the great processor at this price segment in Samsung i.e. exynos 1280(5nm) along with massive 6000mah battery.Overall phone performance, camera is good but it lacks in case of display because it comes with LCD display it should be amoled in this price segment, and lastly charger is not included in the Box... You have to purchase it separately.
Good mobile phone.
Front camera need to be improved.

Hello everyone,I bought this phone because my previous phone completely broke.But been having problems with payment apps and office apps.Upon digging/Googling I understood that it is because messaging doesn't work on M series phones. We cannot save the messaging centre manually,  and it is probably a bug.I tried calling Samsung Customer,  I am hoping I will get a call back from them in a couple of hours and hopefully a fix.Truly truly disappointed, not what I expected from a 20000+ phone.Update:Got a callback next day from Samsung,  they want me to do a bunch of trouble shooting steps. If those don't work, I am to go to the nearest service centre.Please be wary before buying this phone.
Super
Go for it!
Battery drains fast and we cannot feel the presence of 6000 MaH battery. There is heating on back side after using the phone in mild way. Not worth for 18 k...
Good
Good fast phone
Very average camera, fingerprint is also not up to the mark. Overall lagging in performance.Sound and battery excellent..
Battery is not upto the mark
Guys this a honest review about samsung galaxy m331.this phone has a realy good  battary back up around 1 to 2 days2.display is really good with proper colour3.phone realy looks big in your hand and gives you a premium looks4. Processor is really fast5. Camera is ok
Choose other smartphone because Samsung not give charger.Without chargers price show good. After purchase 1200 chargers price. Then costly as compared to other brand.
Mobile running very slow, it will take time to load while we hit any option, even basic android mobile will be not very slow but this mobile is very slow..mobile Network aslo sometimes it will high sometimes it will decrease.. Not worth of cost
Best

Very verybad experience with the brand like samsung.... Bad performance, Dull display, security level very low, Don't buy,more important this product has no resell value. You don't even exchange this phone in flipkart or amazon. So think before buy

If you are looking for a mobile that is slim and light weight then don't go for itIt's too heavy and thick
Mobile is almost good but battery life and camera is not good
Must purchase nice product

Mobile Phon Recvied todayIn which Charge was missing.RegardsRupesh
I baught this phone 7days back . Battery backup is too poor.. you have to charge it twice in a day.....
Lags on heavy gaming . Battery ok
I am using Samsung M33 device over month now The device is really slow compair to my old redmi note 8 pro. Sometimes it gets stuck while I am using specially surffing Instagram, or calls. I was expecting a great performance from this device but it is really not worthy. I don't have any other choice then go back to my old device.
The device satisfies all the basic necessities offering awesome quality
Samsung must provide Amoled display instead of TFT.
Compare than Chinese phone Samsung phone is super at this price.Boycott Chinese item
The product delivered was a dead phone, struggling to get it returned.
Good

Chargers  adapter  isn't  given
In this price segment, for normal use, it is a good phone

Average
After using two weeks I'm going to write this Samsung m33 was not good mobile if you make video call around 20 minutes and during charging time mobile becomes very highly heated and some times hanging its my honest review some one going to buy this product please don't waste your money try any other mobile Thank you
Product is not as good as you think
Finger reader some time not working, camera quality is very very worst...best thing is battery life ..more than 24 hour's backup battery...otherwise waste of money... when some one call caller's name shown after 15 to 20 sec ...some time hanging .... worst experience ever... totally waste of money
Good phone which is 5G enabled. Awaiting 5G launch.
I am facing bad quality camera pictures with this mobile. It's picture looks distorted.
Product received was exactly as in the description. Purchased with anticipation for upcoming 5G network. So, yet to try how the 5G network works in it. Attractive introductory price is a boon, but the separate purchasing of compatible travel adaptor for type C to type C charging cable and no complimentary earphones are additional works for the purchaser.
very good all them
Purchased this Samsung phone long time after using previous Samsung mobile in 2018. Since than had been using other brands viz Oppo, Vivo, Honor etc. However, extremely happy to see the upgraded performance by Samsung for budget phones. 5 star from my side. All in one, a very good phone in its segment.
Fine
Feel value for money. Best is battery life.Could have included charger plug adaptor in package and price accordingly
super ossum 🥰
The design performance and aspects are very average not so good
Nothing to dislike as of now. If you are normal phone user it works very well. Normal user i mean, SMS, Whatapp, GPAY/Paytm/other Online Payment,  the battery last for 4 days. May be if you use for movies it may last 2days. Good Display, Memory, Battery . Though little heavy , but it is very good
One of the best buys in such a low price. I was able to get this at close to 13000. Huge 6000 mah battery, good speed with 8 GB RAM. Seen no lag. UI interface is also amazing. Screen is so smooth. Loving using this  phone. On the whole this is a great budget buy.
Nice
the only positive thing is battery life .. getting 17-18 hrs screen time. rest isn't good. my 2 years old m31 performance is better than this phone even with camera quality.
Phone hearting issue during charging and making or receiving calls.
Happy
Not that good futures
Good
Fingerprint reader is good.  Battery is not good 6000mha Battery but backup not good like 3000mah. Camera quality is good

Good battery 🔋 backup , Picture clearity is too good , one Thing I want request #Samsung that please provide Charger  Adopter with every mobile 📱 handset and rest everything is fine 🙂

Since last six months i was searching good phone in my budget below 18K. This phone i got has all the features which i required. It is value for money phone. Good Sound, Camera and performance. Long Battery Life.

Overall it is a good product
#1 Camera quality  is average#2 Doesn't  feel like 120hz refresh  rate more likely  60#3 Battery is  most disappointing  draining  at rate of almost 10% in an hour,  and I have just used it for 4 days (no gaming,  no GpS usage, no excessive  streaming, not heavy apps usage) feels like using an old phone and u can imagine what will happen  with 5g Sim 4 Don't know  what cool technology they are using  but it is heating  up even with basic operationsDon't  buy this phone plenty of other better options  available,  brand is no longer trustworthy.
Battery backup  not good
Amazon service is not satisfied....
Very good phone with aswome battery 🔋 backup.
Best in class with brand Samsung! Superb battery, functions very smooth. A great product by Samsung!
M33 mobile hang between use and not work as specific 8 gb ram speed .It is very bad experience after a long time use of samsung phone.
Sparingly used and mentioned waiting for 5G as that test will really give 80% of phone,thanks
Heating issue for the Samsung phones
Literally speaking apart from handset there is nothing in the box, even the packaging was pathetic. have just started using the phone, hope atleast the handset meets the expectations, cutting cost doesn't mean depriving the customer of his basic accessories. Samsung is just on the verge of becoming the next Nokia. Have been using samsung for the past 12 years, but if the same continues my next brand will not be a samsung phone
No adapter/charger provided with this handset.This is very ridiculous...Additional 1300/- Rs. keep ready for Adapter/charger.
Camera is not best.
Fingerprint reader is side one can be improvedGood quality quad camera 50 mega pixelsA high definition processor for gaming6000mAh battery

Awesome phone, must buy it. Sound quality is very good.
Not includes a charger but still comes with a whole bunch of features sports Samsung latest 1UI 4.1 with android 12. The camera is just insane with so many different mode with the upscaling if 108mp nd the remove object edit is also good

Very good mobile
Bakwas battery backup
Good battery good camera and super specs in extremely reasonable price
Good Phone overall
Good 👍
I haven’t faced any heating issues till now. Only concern is, there is no earphones and charger adapter with the pack which I had to buy it additionally. If they could offer, it would be amazing.
I bought this phone on 10th April, 2022 and i am really impressed with the performance. No hang, No lagging, No heatup in any case has observed till date. Battery Backup is superb and one must easily used multiple app at one time without any issues. In one word i can say " SAMSUNG HAS DEVELOPED A KING IN ITS SEGMENT"
So I bought this phone recently and while travelling on a bike few drops of rain might have entered the bag in which this phone was kept and next day screen started to act weird. There is not a micro level of water protection in the phone. The samsung store charged a hefty sum for the screen change and I still regret my decision to buy this phone, lured by good specs on the screen where the basic things are a miss.
Good moblie
Box doesn't have charger. Which is very useful thing. Even Phone weight is too much. Over phone is good. but I expect more from Sumsung.
Very good
Battery life is not good. M21 has the same capacity but lasts longer than this phone. Everything else is fine in the product.
the display is horrible.. not worth at all. you can only watch youtube or netflix or prime video at 480 pixel only. although it shows only 1000pixel but the quality is just 480 pixel.Camera is a tragedy.... a 5000Rs camera  phone is far better than this.... I was cheated by this product both my manufacturer and seller. There is no return for me soo i m still sufferring with this mobile.Battery is 5830 mah which looks like normal 5000 mah as it comes only 1 day with wifi usage.Its 5G supported , but it not shows 5 G for me eventhough im a Airtel Bangalore Customer. It shows as 4G+No adapter,  Samsung  cheat you by giving a type-C to type-C cable not USB one ...
Camera quality  superb, best at this price.Battery  life is awesome,,,with  100% you can use all dayDevice Functions  well and good
Battery life is very low. Not working according to 6000 mah battery. Draining very fast.
Camera is not good
I purchased this M33 phone in Jul 2022 assuming this is a 5G phone. I am in Chennai and a Airtel customer. Now that 5G is enabled by Airtel in Chennai, I changed the setting to 5G but it is not working at all. When I contacted Samsung customer service, the agent informed that there is some technical issue with M33 5G phone and Samsung technical team is working on the same. They still did not identify what is the issue and how to fix this issue. It is not just M33 5G model having the issue, agent read out long list of Samsung 5G models having this technical issue.  There is NIL communication from Samsung about this technical issue and they are taking customers for granted.  I am disappointment and extremely unhappy with the Samsung.
We have received mobile . But there's only mobile, the cable and adaptor is missing. Manual is also missing.Only box with mobile is received. Kindly let me know how will I get the other requirements of this mobile.
Mobile is continuously hanging.
Awesome 120Hz display,it's quite bright and show excellent colours,doesn't seem that it  have TFT display.Battery backup is sufficient,fingerprint sensor is fast,best UI in market with latest Android 12,good camera quality.Particular samsung features Knox security,secure folder,etc makes it a valuable phone in this price segment.Timely security patches updates is a key feature of Samsung.
It is a average phone with decent camera dont expect anything more. Charger is not included and costs 1700 extra which makes it more costlier and not satisfactory.
This mobile phone is very poor no buy ,battery drain very fast,camera quality us very poor and not performing in 18000 rupees
Best in class and price
Very good
Charge not given with mobile. During gaming mobile heat up. Heavy weight and battery life not good
Finger print work on average performance and battery life is good to use one and half day.
Cost is a bit high. you cannot find any charging adaptor. Screen quality is below average. In this price segment, if compare to other available options, disappointed with Samsung's quality.
I m very disappointed about  this  phone. Camera  quality  is  very  poor.....
Very good phone in this price range! Where you are getting exchange offers and card offers as well!
Display screen is not better and no Adapter charger and some time screen not workSome time network problem
Everything is fine, performance is good, camera quality is good, battery is also long lasting, charging is very fastValue for money, go for it 👍👍
with the present day dependence on a good cell for all our needs good battery back up + over all good performance +a noted brand and MADE IN INDIA touched my patriotism. after i decided not to by made in China. I suggest others also follow this.
Battery discharges pretty quickly as compared other new phones I have experienced before.From night till morning it loses 4% - 5% battery just like that with data in switched off mode. Also, I have removed all the apps which I don't use. In writing this review the battery has gone down by 1%. May be it is 6000 MAH that's why.Finger print reader is also very slow in reading and every now and then gives message cover complete sensor.
Waste of money as camera quality is so poor not happy with the mobile
Looks stylish and wieght less. But only one drawback is no charger included in the box.
Please don't waste your hard earned money to buy this bakwas phone.
The phone found new and un opened. Battery life is ok, camera quality is good, overall value for money.
Camera quality  very low fully disappointed 😞
Worst battery life
Super phone very light weight good fast and smooth network very fast when compared my old phone m20Very like so much thanks to Samsung and AmazonI am very confused to get new phone anytime Samsung is my brand
I got this for 15,000 with a credit card offer. I purchased it for my mom to replace her clunky old phone so it's a big upgrade.Phone came well packaged and no issues setting it up. So far, I'm happy with the purchase.
Camera nd battery-  felt can be of more quality
This is my first ever samsung mobile. Unfortunately samsung lived upto it's negative  publicity of allowing limited  features.  Android 12 is not fully optimised to it's potential, only 1 or 2 gestures provided. Only WhatsApp is showing as dual app no other app. I WAS USING MORE APPS ON MY REALME 2PRO IN DUAL APP SETUP.  BATTERY MANAGEMENT IS OK BUT IF YOU ARE NOT USING PHONE BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY GOOD. DISPLAY IS ALSO GOOD AND COLORS ARE GOOD. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE NOT GOOD FOR A PHONE PRICED AT 25K. I AM EXTREMELY ANGRY WITH THE CHEAP MARKETING GIMMICKS BEING PLAYED BY SAMSUNG INDIA. 1. NOT PROVIDING ADAPTER , ONE HAS TO PURCHASE SEPARATELY. 2. SAMSUNG WAS OFFERING FREE AFAPTER AS GIFT ON ITS OWN SAMSUNG ESHOP APP AND WEBSITE DURING FAB FEST IF PURCHSED DIRECTLY FROM THERE ALONG WITH CREDIT CARD DISCOUNT. 3. NOW SAMSUNG HAS LAUNCHED THIS PHONE WITH A NEW COLOUR AND I LIKE THIS NEW COLOUR BUT I HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED GREEN WITH 8 GM 128 CONFIG. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST ALMOST 10 DAYS AND FOUND FEW CONS: PHONE IS HEATING WHILE CHARGING. PHONE HANGS IN BETWEEN. PHONE DIALER IS SLOW, ONE HAS TO WAIT FOR CALL TO GET DIALED AFTER CLIXKING TAKES ALMOST 3-5 SECONDS. WONT RECOMMEND this phone to anyone.
Poor battery performance.
Like it!!!
Slow, not as demonstrated in advertisement.
1. Fingerprint sensor is over sensitive2. Battery performance dropped from 2nd month of usage3. Phone becomes unresponsive very frequently and reboots4. A bit bulky & heavyThe above makes it an average phone.
Don't buy given charging cable both side c type and not given adaptor charges extra rs 1500/-
Should have provided travel adapter
Decent phone for average user
Wt of the product must be less than what currently is
Mobile battery drain problem and camera also not good
Overall good phone, but amoled display could be there rather than lcd in this price range
In 20k good mobile  camera quality is good battery life is also good quality of video and photos extremely good fingerprint reader working fine .if any one searching for mobile  in 20k I will suggest samsung m33 go for it
Camera quality is poor
Mobile works very well, but its little heavy with good camera & battery life. If you want amazon pay credit card benifit to buy this phone ping me on isnta- Darsh kaushal
But 1 star less for not giving charger or proper data cable
Very quick access , amazing touches & camera quality really loved most !!!
Camera quality not good
For everyday use this phone is best. 2 days of battery life on normal use. Camera is good. Screen is good. Sound is good. Processor is fast. I am happy with my purchase. Thank you samsung and amazon.
Mobile overheated ......🔥🔥🔥🔥
Very nice mobile, using from  7 days, no lagging , battery is running 2 days after heavy net use also and Bulit quality is very good. Thanks to Samsung India
I've used this smartphone for a week & haven't faced any issues so far. Fully satisfied with battery, performance & camera.
Getting adds on screen like Korean phones. Battery drains quickly. Data loss is huge in background. Overall phone is good.
Phone looks premium but a bit slow. Major draw back no charger available this costs you 1000-1200 extra.
Too heavy, side finger unlock mechanism is not successful
Battery is poor 6000mah should not be drained fast
Good for parents not for heavy gamers. Very low performance
Phone camera capture
Nice product💯
Battery is very badCharge drained very fast
Battery is seriously awesome. You can go for it. Overall a fantastic package within 20k bucket.
The Phone is decent mid ranger. NICE performance.
Ok
I bought this product for my mom who until now had been using a Moto G5 PLUS. Samsung has done an awful jon with the product. The build and all is okay but the phone hangs a lot and is slower than the Moto G5 plus which launched around 5 years ago.The battery backup is good but do note you don't get a charging brick with this phone and would have to spend another Rs 1200 to get a 25W charger. Disappointed in Samsung mid range phones. Best to avoid and go for a different brand.
No issue
adapter not received
As I bought in season sale one of worst experience with this phone camara was not at all good, display was too worst .if you try to return they will not accept too if I give the rating for overall i will give 1rating don't buy go for better one
Only display is not amoled but 120hz compensates for it, everything is perfect.
GOOD
fast processing, user friendly happy to use this mobile.
Same hanging problem
Poor battery quality.
Very good (but not excellant) 5G phone in this price range. Started using from last few weeks, so far faced issue when 120hz enabled it shows sluggishness, wifi reception quality is not good and sometimes chat messages do not sync instantly but as wifi disabled then msgs starts coming. More detailed review after more usage.One big issue which I did not noticed before buying - only 1 sim can be on 5G at a time, other sim will fall to 4G (other brands offer dual 5G, dual 5G standby)
With only normal browsing and YouTube not even giving full one day backup. Was using moto phones before this with 3000 mah battery and it is giving similar backup.Also frame drop in BGMI is on the higher side. You will not be able to play the game. M21 is much better option even for the same price. Also no option to disable Ram plus. 120 Hz seems to be only marketing gimmick. Only thing which is in favour is 2+4 years of update. That will also time tell.EditUpdating the review after using for almost 1 month. Phone was never fast but now after one month performance has degraded even more. Phone has serious issue with multi tasking. You are listing music and at the same time let's say you opened some app, you will notice lag in the music while the app is opening. In some places you can't use you installed keyboard and have to work with samsung keyboard. Even after phone update and bgmi update, still have to use the smooth high, phones at 10k can run the game in better settings. Even basic tasks like dialler still takes 5-6 seconds to load, both when calling/receiving. Working on ms teams or outlook is a nightmare in this phone as it takes it's own time to perform the tasks. Overall very very slow phone. Not at all recommended.
Samsang M33 is working fine,  it's speed and battery backup is excellent.
Speaker problem.
Fhd display is concern. SAmoloed must be there.Phone cause heating on use.Internet (using on jio fibre) is some how slower than MI
For a normal phone user, most imp is battery namaste this has big battery backup. For the first time for me, fingerprint reader works at the first go which impressed me.
Best mobile on this price segment
Good
Atleast have some courtesy for customers ..charge your customers 500 extra but provide adapter...this phone is same like m31 m32 nothing new ..it's just written about the new features but same experience like the old ones ..don't feel the ram is 8 gb
Very good phono
Not... worthy😡😡
network reception is not good. The phone software is not properly optimised.
The delivery service was not at all good and Amazon needs to have better delivery partners in order to maintain their good customer satisfaction history.
I was reluctant to order a Samsung phone always being concerned about touch feel and response but I was surprised to to see the touch is as premium as on my iPhone XR. Battery back is definitely a + and so is the camera quality. Fantastic for recording videos.
Should have been provided back side instead of rightside
I'm a non-gaming user of mobile. After using the mobile for 3 weeks I'm totally satisfied with its battery life and performance. Macro mode of the camera could've been better but all in all decent camera too. Can't complain as I got the mobile at 16,800 after applying offers.
Shame on Samsung for not giving a charger at this price . will curse Samsung every time I charge it light Sensors also not showing up in sensors listFront camera is just 8 mp. Other than main rear camera rest are just gimmick n almost uselessIn 2022 they are still selling tft although quality is OKPhone is full of bloatware at startup but thankfully most are removableevery now and then It heats up a bit even if no heavy task runningIn conclusion it's yet another overpriced average phone from Samsung
I am loving it for enhanced performance and features overall.
You can go for this phone it is a good deal at a price point of 15K
Phone gets heated up quickly on moderate internet usage and on calls usage also..
I dislike this product as I observe that it is not 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM phone because it's processing is very very slow. When we download anything from Play Store it takes so much time,  it's downloading process is very very slow.  It consumes so much time to download. It  is not flexible phone. It's video clarity is also very rough,  there is no clear video,the video is always dim, you cannot read and identify the study material when you do study online, you see dim everything. As I think I get a renewed phone which is already used,  there is some sign of previously used,  so I am unsatisfied to buy this product. I am unsatisfied. The system should provide me a best phone as I pay a large amount of money so I am unsatisfied. Also,the market value of this phone in Parwanoo is only 16449 rupees and I paid 17999 rupees on Amazon. As I observe within 7 days the working of this phone is very poor in every way...IMPRESSION:-wastage of money
I liked the product and am happy to use this
Don't wait and think any more ...it's best and trustworthy Samsung band has delivered best at this price ...
I love Samsung phone because it durable .But now is competing with Chinese products . Happy to using such product which is loaded features.
Touch not so good. Heating issue.
Sumsung ke phone or uski service ka javab nahi hai low cost and superb qulity abd service
Very bad phone from connectivity point of view. Phone hang, call disconnection, many problems. Do not buy
Thanks
Camera, Battery and fingerprint reader is good but I am facing internet connectivity issue.
No adapter with mobile, ,and given data cable can't use with old Samsung adapter.  Very disappointed with this product. It's same as m32 5g.
Good
My 4 year old Realme 1 is working much faster than this. Become worst just after android 13 upgrade. 6, 128 GB phone working like a 2, 16 GB phone. It's performance is worst may be due to exynose processor. I don't recommend. Better go for realme, redmi, OnePlus, iqoo etc.
Not satisfied
Nice
face lock not work properly
Super
Without charger plan is worst.Camera Quality is not Good.Poor battery performance.
Good
It's of good quality and has 12 5G bands which no other brand phones offer. Recommended for ppl who wish to keep mobile for longer period 3 to 4 years.
Till now going good. Good camera, battery life, wonderful sound, easy to use and navigate. I want to see if it lasts for 6 years and still going like my last Samsung galaxy J7 phone that I bought in 2016.
Galaxy M33 phone performance is awesome. Phone look is elegant. Camera quality is excellent. Phone charges quickly with 25W adapter. Battery back up is also sufficient for whole day with continuous usage. This product is worth for the money invested.
Not worth for this high price
Charger nahi mila
I loved it for basic usage
We don't have received charger or data cable and sim adjust pin we have Received mobile only
Overall good product if u are looking for a 5G mobileBattery life is goodCamera quality is also good
Camera was not working and unable to scan barcode..samsung care fixed the problem. Online orders harassment...
adaptor not given if seprate purcahse it cost around 1500
Not really happy with the overall performance. I guess the M series is not really fab...a fac
camera very poor poor
Charger not received 😒
I Liked --Camera, Battery backup, Display, Look, In hand feel, User interface, Sound output, Connectivity.I didn't like --No charger, no case cover, no pre applied screen protectorI purchased 25 watt samsung pd charger @1149₹ separately, overall  phone is best in this price, you will not regret your purchase 👍 go for it👍
The phone is good. I had got this for Dad. It is light weight, does the necessary functions smoothly, battery lasts good. I think this phone is good for anyone looking for mid range phone irrespective of age.
This phone has both software and hardware issues. I have put a consumer complain and came to know. All need to put consumer complain. Samsung has to replace the phone. So file a complaint against Samsung put.ltd.
I m using tis product for taking photos for my workThey could take extra money and add charrger also
Battery backup is not better
Weight a bit high. Heat up soon, refresh rate is slow. No charger. No back over. No screen guard. You will get only handset and 1 cable.
Battery life very bad. Drain very fast and drain in half day in only call.
Really good. Enjoying M33 5G mobile phone. Worth more than the price that too from an established brand. No hangup, No heating, multiple screens working at a time. Good security. No worry for battery drainout.Thank you Team Samsung for a good economic 5G phone.
Please replace the charger as it has same port on both sides
No coms yet.using for month.battery one ophimised for usage gives great backup.camera performs excellent as per budget.runs smooth without lag.and samsung trust overall loved it in this budget
The box is without samsung original charger for 25 w fast charging battery of 6000mh
Great phone
Today am recived the phone in the box no Accessories n side of the box so iam returned the same ,
Amazon / samsung is it a part of design or some manufacture defect
Happy and satisfied customer.
Phone is ok.. just getting hot when using on a call
Received usb cable but... Its have no usb side both sides are C type connector
It is a good phone in your budget.With All specifications and 5G band this is a good deal
Out of 8gb ram will get only 4gb free RAM which is worst experience.Poor rear camera quality. 16MP other phone camera works better than Samsung  M33 5g. Front camera doesn't give good quality pictures.FHD+ screen  quality is good and okay.Battery  feels like its 5000 mAh.Fast charger is good. But Not super fast.Overall phone is below you're expectations.It's not a mid range phone. It's starting  range phone with 5g chip. Don't expect  too much before buying.Below average phone. ☹️😢
Relatively thik and heavy due to 6000 mAH battery. Camera is inferior than competitionRest is ok
It takes more time to response.
Screenshot is too hectic in all Samsung make phone. That needs to be updated.
So far, I am facing hanging issue  and sometimes the center button has automatically blinking continuously.
Front camera quality could have been better but overall it's a nice phone...
If you want  a good samsung phone within 15K then go for it. Charger and back cover not included but  the mobile is great. for normal day to day use this is good with brand value.
Average  phone  budget  phone
Back panel easily cracked when fall just from sofa. performance is good.
Good phone at this price range
The battery lasts almost forever, camera shots are awesome
Amazing 50MP 1080p camera quality captures minute details, great quality in both front and back camera. Great performance with smooth animations and a quick startup time. Ready with 5G capibilities is great for upcoming networks.
I took 8gb phone and it is working fine.1. No heating issues2. Long battery backupMy last phone was samsung J7 prime and has only 3GB ram, so had memory issues and also battery backup is low. With this new phone my issues are gone
Good
Software bugs
Camera is not good
The fingerprint sensor at the side is not appropriate. It must have to be at front.
Wrist camera quality
Nice mobile but no cashback received...it's a clear fraud
It's too heavy and comes without adapter.Feels like using old generation Nokia 3310 handset, may be heavier than that I guess.If you charge using normal adapter, it would take more than 1 hour to charge and the 25 watt charger would cost > 1400 unless you go for a cheaper one for which you would end up paying atleast 1000.Battery performance is fine, camera is average. Only thing I like was storage
Product arrived in good shape. Only issue is - Samsung not providing charger for this budget segment mobile. Actual mobile is better than what it's shown here on images.
Battery function is very bad. I expected that 6000 mah battery means which will provide more backup. I thought hardware inside used consuming lot of power means poor technology hatdware inbuilt in the phone.
Battery life is good.camera quality is up to the mark.nice fingerprint reader.
Bought this mobile based on past experience of Samsung but disappointed. Phone hangs when u get incoming calls (atleast 30% of calls u recieve) placed request to replace. Replaced handset was no better and now Amazon has denied to service it because there so called app minspect is not able to diagnose the issue and hence no defect proven. This will be my last handset of Samsung and last online purchase. Long live Samsung
Excellent
In 20,000/-, it is a worst buy, phone has major heating problem. After 30 min of use phone becomes heat. And battery life maximum 8 hour. 6000 mah bakwas h.
Very heavy
Camera is good.
Camera is poorTouch is not up to the markHeavy
It's heavy bulky phone like compas box.. only battery capacity is good.  Look also not good
Initial impression - Very poor displayGood battery life as expectedToo heavyJust another  mid range phone
Camera  quality  very poor. Very poor Battery backup. Display average.
camera quality ok, bulky phone.
Not worth for 18k
Long battery life
It is an awesome phone
Finger print was not working properly..
sometimes -4/10 times i cannot hear or the other person cannot hear me on phone call. this is frustrating. i have to restart the phone every time it happens.i have purchased 2 phones and both have same problemunable to update the time it is 3 minutes faster than the actual time.i want to know if i can get replacement
Camera quality and display not as expected.
Front camera is not good
Ok for price of 16k. Tft display not very brilliantGood batterySuitable for entry level users
I received  just a mobile and cable. Screen guard, back cover purchased separately. I have already one samsung mobile, this is second one. No complaints about this m33.its good.
I liked all the features,  wonderful battery backup. Awesome camera. I use it to shoot my cooking videos for my youtube channel.  I just love this phone. Thank you  Samsung and thank you  Amazon.
Battery life best
Works well. Charging is faster. Camera quality is Decent. Better to buy charger with it since you may not find 25W in less cost.
I like the camera quality and smoothness of phone, easy to handle. It's a good product.My opinion is there are not dislikes in it everything is good.I use it for myself and home purposes
Nice product with economy
I was looking a phone which is good in performance, camera and battery also,now after using 4-5days I can say you can buy it without any hesitation, only one thing can disappointed to you that is adapter because you have to buy it separately. Thanks
Nice qualities
Very good performance
Good
this is one of the best options currently available in this price range. lots of customisation possible. Samsung one UI is also better than MiUi. just go for it
Thik thak hai
Display and camera could be better
Mobile is bit heavy
Wrost products not buy it
Good phone, satisfactory
Good
Low battery backup
Awesome mobile
Dialer perform slow
Beautiful mobile phone.... Few features I had in my Samsung M31 not present here like slide the hand to take a screenshot n few others. On the whole very happy with my smart purchase... 👍❤️🙏🌹
It's awesome budget mobile, I reviewing after using 1 month.If you're not game lover then go for it, it's battery backup very good.All day battery. Average charge lasting 20-28 hours depend on your usage.
Good product.
Not worthy for the amount paid for this. It's previous models are better than this in Camera quality at lesser price.Most important thing is Samsung also cheating the customers by not giving the Charger along with Phone and selling it for Rs: 1200/- separately.Including Charger it costs Rs 19200/- not worthful.
This mobile is really monster, go for it.Dont know why people are giving less stars for charger, when Samsung already mentioned that charger needs to be purchase seperately.Mobile is awesome, performance is really impressive, lookwise is really decent. Camera is also good, light weight.
Camera quality
I like this
Gud product
Battery backup of phone is very good. Overall phone is good in this range.
Noticed with every single samsung phone they keep on pushing updates which make your phone slow and deteriorate camera so you are compelled to buy a new phone every few years
product is good..bit heavy after applying cover and screen guard
Excellent  Phone. Could have given charger as well
Just 2 cons 1.no charger 2.no amoled screenBut for this price segment it's very acceptable and the deal is great simply go for it
Battery does not performing as 6000 mah....it's  like 3500 mah.Although the phone is made with 5nm processor, the battery optimization is also very bad.Camera algorithm is not good
Best Quality
After 20 days usage : This is an another mobile having super quality in battery life, camera quality, processing speed.Only one thing we are not getting travel adapter, earphone with this product. And that okay, price was more worthable for handset.
Very low performance on gaming
I was using a oppo f11pro. Comparing with that I didn't see any feature which is more comfortable.  Camera _it's average, Screenshot _not user friendly, Sound  quality _better.When you dial a number,it takes irritating 4secs to get to the dialling screen...Its is taking almost 3hrs for full charging of battery...And moreover, you have to buy a charger separately (i think its the same for most of the phones now)..You dont get an inbuilt music player. You have to download a music player separately and you have to bear all those unwanted  ads too....After 11years i bought a samsung mobile..But now i regret my decision...I don't recommend samsung m33...
Its best
Finger print sensor is not working properly
The phone works smoothly and has great battery power allowing for all day, sometime more than 24 hours, of constant use. The display is bright and the camera quality is also great.
Not good
Dislike that you have not given  charger with phone
Samsung should supply charger alongwith the mobile.
Too much heating after 1 hour use..Camera Quality not upto mark as per mentionedPhone comes 6+128GB mode but when you open that phone out of 128 GB storage phone takes 30GB and out of 6 Gb ram phone takes  2.5GB for their internal process. Even Ram plus working as per description... Phone getting hang if you continually use 2-3 hours watching movies/Web series..Phone heated and hang too much, so you can't play games for long time.Phone will be work if you have only basic use like calling, SMS and Social media chats
It's working time is very slow and I'm facing hangig problems in short it is worst phones
Awesome and amazing
It's  good handset in this budget.  Samsung try to maintain its price by not giving charger with the handset like iPhone. It's good camera and battery life in this budget phone also comes with 5G.
Gd 👍
Never purchase Samsung mobiles. I got this mobile just before a month and now its gets hang and it's very slow. Waste of all your money once if you choose Samsung. Finger print sensor wil take nearly 4 times to get opened. Camera showing some different colours for different pics. Waste of  money.  Never choose Samsung.
Charging Adaptor No,So Waste of Money Don't Buy Mobile.....😡😡😡😡
Battery is good but average camera and screen quality
Best phone in budget 17000 with 5G ,50 mega pixel camera
Have been using phone for last 3 days. So far so good. It's running very smooth. Battery backup is decent. Kudos to Amazon and delivery boy who delivered it at almost exact time as mentioned on the order. Phone deserves atleast 4 stars but I have deducted 1 star because of hypocrisy of Samsung. They are not providing charger citing the reason to save the environment while at the same time forcing buyers to purchase it separately. So, dear Samsung team, please let us know how does it affects the environment less when we are purchasing the charger separately and a delivery boy is burning fuel, seller wasting another piece of paper for packaging to deliver it separately instead of delivering it along the phone itself. So, please save the image of environment saviour, that you want to portray yourself, for some other promotional event.After few months usage, decreasing the stars to 1. Lots of space still available on phone but it's pathetically slow. Keeps on lagging with minimal usage. Read somewhere it's because of type of storage samsung is using in this phone, not sure though. It takes a lot of time in opening any app, sending msg on WhatsApp. From past few days, it gets restarted randomly on any screen. Worst mobile purchase till date for me.
Need to buy saperately charger around  rupees 1750
I was looking for a longer battery backup mobile and this ended on Galaxy M33 5G. I am happy to using this product and would like to recommend for this.
Sensor is not at the back but rather at side, adjacent to volume buttons and often fail to validate the right fingerprints. Calls sometime doesn't appear on screen or not highlighted.Quick responses are limited in no. of characters, expected at least 3 msgs length (this is required to send in non-english).Charge drain quicker than it is expected.Overall, would advise to purchase this mobile only if no other option.
Good camera+storage+battery high ma
Poor camera
I bought M33 5g.But the phone heats on simple scrolling while reading web pagesThis inspite of turning off 120hz modeSamsung needs to urgently check this.Two hours of reading and scrolling drained off 25% of battery while my 4 year old Redmi Note5 doesn't heat or drain battery so fast for same amount of activity.I also had MI max2 whose battery lasted almost 3 daysThis phone battery inspite of being bigger lasts at max 1.25 daysPhone has special cooling  tech and processor is 5nm but still heating issuesCamera even if u turn landscape clicks photos in potrait ... takes lot of time to detect orientation or does not derect orientation18000 phone does not have procimity sensor n light sensorThey use camera for it and its worst ... does not adjust screen brightness properly and takes lot of time to do it or even forgets to adjust it auto ... u have to do it manuallyPhone should have been priced 15000/- at max or at least AMOLED screen should have been givenHEATING ISSUES FOR SIMPLE SD VIDEOS VIEWING OR SCROLLING WHILE READINGTHEIR COOLING TECHNOLOGY LOOKS TOTALLY CRAPMoto G52 5g looks better in comparison
Overall a Good Phone.Battery backup is good.Video clarity is awesome.
verymuch satisfied with the performance.yet to verify the 5G characters.
*This is for samsung!!* 😡Haven't used the phone till now, but Whats the issue with providing charger. Already paying good price for phones, then they don't even provide complete package.In case of this particular phone, They have provided cable. This cable has C type ports on both the sides, which means you can't use other adapters you already have.. And ultimately phone is unusable unless you buy a new adapter which comes around Rs 1000.Why these companies are moving towards this?Imagine buying laptop without charger, you are  forced to pay more for the items, which are inherent part of the main product..Charger should be there in package. 🤷‍♀️
This is my First Mobile from Samsung ... and now I feel like I did a mistake in purchasing this product.1. No Adapter .. Only C type cable is provide. We should buy a adopter which costs around 1200/-.2. C Type cable is use less -  Both the Ends are with 'C' Type.3. Heating issue - Even after using for 5 minutes of whats App .. Mobile is generating lot of heat..4. Camera quality is poor.
Ok phone
This phone has a monster battery, good camera quality, can use it to binge watch series  & movies and play games, good for gaming also.
Ok
It's good mobile
Weight of mobile is high, I didn't see the weight when I buy.  Apart this mobile is superb.
It doesn't include charger
Good product at reasonable rate
Quality os okay.
Great 👍
it's awesome in all aspects. I did not like the screen shot method. using buttons is complicated swiping screen is more comfortable. overall I did like my M 33 5g thank u I like its finger print reader feature more safety. battery life is good
good value for money
I purchased with a fresh technology mind but got all the old stuff within a new packing..
automatically going to recycle bin then it's deleted
Good mobile..got 2k discount on icici card. Camera is good and mobile is fast
Nice phone with best feature
Not recommended...
Charger Adapter which is an essential accessory with any phone was missing and was not part of package.  A clear mislead/cheat to show a reduced price.The charging cable that came with the package was defective and not usable, since both ends of the charger cable was C type. When there are no USB point, how can we connect it to any adapter or laptop to charge it.  A clear disappointment from Samsung.  You need to replace the charger cable Free of cost
Camera quality is not good as Samsung provide 50MP, it shows like a 5MP quality
Did not like the cell phone quality. Amazon sent a professional who did agree that phone sound is not at par. Asked to reach out to Amazon. Amazon turned blind eye, we are stuck with a product we don't like. Better to buy cell phones from a local store. Stay away from Amazon.in at all costs. You're better off buying something from a local store by checking the quality.Amazon support was super rude, they will disconnect your call and say they are bound to disconnect the call. There is no escalation route. You're stuck with purchase with no option to return or replace with a better product.
Bought a 8gb variant after going through the details minutely and was impressed by the specifications, but the happiness was short lived. Videos stop playing in the gallery and all video streaming apps like prime video, Netflix, hotstar etc.. Then have to force stop the gallery, clear cache and data of the gallery and restart time and again the entire day. Don't know what's the bug, although all apps have been updated and so is the OS.. #samsungindia pls advise
There is no charging adaptor , only we received charging wire
Samsung is best.no one can challenge to this product
I like it specialy its bsttery lifeSamsung a safe brand so go for itBest cam quality rivals iphone se's
Excellent phone in given pricing. Although it's bit bulky due to 6000mha battery. Photo quality is good. Customizable interface for those who are wants to stick to stoke Android.
Samsung is always a trusted brand. This mobile is good for all features in reasonable price specially battery backup and processor.With latest version of android and its superb features it is best in class.
The phone is awesome except its screen glass quality. On the second day of purchase, the glass broke when the phone accidentally fell from a short height on the floor.
Extra cost to put buy on adapter and headset.
I purchased this phone in the hope of batter connectivity and I also purchased airtel Sim because airtel hasv5G service in Delhi. But this phone does not support 5G. I even contacted Samsung customer service and the customer executive said "sir it will support after a patch update". I asked him , " to Kar do bhai update". He replied we don't have update right now. In future we may have update. Very bad experience with Samsung M33 5G
Pros : High performance, lag free.average camera with some additional features.Dual sim with external memory card slot.Battery performance is good. Doesnt heats while gaming too.Inbuilt screen recording & call recording.Cons : No charger.Sound is pathetic. Seems like a low-cost cellphone in sound output.Camera is of not premium quality given the price.Even with a 25w charger, the charging is slightly slow.TFT screen.
No charger but at least usb-type c should have provided.
Separate sd slot comes in handy can be used to expand memory storage. Phone has around 36 hours backup with BT wifi two sims.also 5G support good for future. Using for one month now
Sturdy phone with great looks and colour. Smooth functioning. Display quality very clear and touch is very responsive. 25w fast charging working well. Camera quality is gd and best in range. Audio crystal clear. 6000mah battery is very helpful.An awesome product to buy.
Device is not working properly, facing problem with unlock the screen, unable to take screen shots, unable to varify receiving calls, screen going to black, Heating, want to replace the device please advise urgently, or else I should escalate the matter, please contact me on priority basis as I am unable to connect with your team.
Overall function is very good, camera quality and speakers are excellent,  go for it.....
Very good product with best in class features
Samsung has managed to put best in the world together with this handset. I got it in inaugural offer with 2000 instant discount and six months zero cost emis with ICICI credit card. It would have been better if they included adopter also.
Below average camera
Phone frequently shows No Internet connection. Service center Nizamabad unable to detect the problem.We have replaced SIM also,but of no use.
Very good model
Charger not included.
Camera quality is good and the battery life is best, and most important it doesn't hang the processor is very fast as well. Overall a good phone to buy.
No issue was found while ordering the plan.
It’s a just fair!
I recommend it to all those who are looking for a medium range of phones.For Battery Backup - 5/5, Camera 4/5, Fingerprint - 4/5, Display - 4/5.
Good to use this phone
Good for business and official work.
Health Mobile for starting
I am right using this mobike for 2 month The mobile is ok ok type  , battery life last longer,camera quality is below average, fingerprint is not working most of the time,and in this price adaptor is not provided so I felt some other  option better than this not satisfied with this
Over heating and hanging problem...Worst product in Amazon...
Mujhe hang hone wale phone bilkul pasand nahi hai maine Coll rekord ki wajay se ye Samsung ka fon liya hai warna kabhi nahi leta ।
Camera clarity obseltuley worstBattery backup is also disappointedSoftware pathetic
Totally worst experience with this phone..this Phone don't have return option i didn't see first that clearly.. after buy this this mbl i got detected piece so i suffered with daily return calls replacement options and what ever I don't like and I wasted my time mostly 15days for this mbl only .
Dislike
Ok
Third class processor and phone is lagging only in first week of purchase.
Finger sensor ,camera,battery life and smart features are marvellous.
Go for it value for money
I don't like this product
Excellent Phone !! Great Camera !! Great sound !! Great Speed Overall very much satisfied phone in this range.
I like this phone mainly because of its battery life
Its ridiculous samsung doesn't provide charger within the box. This is cheating. I got type c to c cable. Atleast give usb to type c cable i could have used it with old mobile charger. what am i supposed to do with c to c cable???Now i have to buy usb to type c connector separately to be able to charge the phone.
The all the sensors,battery life,camera is good.
Not good.. Network problem any time....every
Without Adapter is a biggest loss for customer
I love all of the samsung's feature
Aacha hai mobile sab chij me. Par thoda bhari hai (shyad 210 gm)
Very good m33 but charger is not available charger purchase is 1149 rupay 25 watt finger lock is very fast but face unlock is diley samsung mobile is very good chinies mobile is bad
A phone at low cost high expectations...personally I didn't like it because1) Battery drains fast for my usage2) processor is slow especially internet buffering, atleast it should live upto it's auto Ram expansion, I am not finding 8+8 Ram help in processing....3) UI is not great earlier I used Huawei P20 pro, I can feel the difference ....well it's understood for cost difference.
Battery life is very low. 5 hrs Battery life
It is a nice experience to use this phone.Battery life is too good.Picture quality is too good, budget friendly phone.
Good products value of money.
Latest digital advance features with best 5G mobile.
The product is not at all good.
Best phone to have at such rate
I want to return the product because its camera is defective .. Not getting focus images appears blur.. What is the procedure
I am giving 5 star for phone but the most important thing adaptor is not foundMy suggestion its basic and important thing for mobile  and it should be added with mobile
Camera quality is good
I feel very happy using this phone everything is good
Liked overall feel. Battery backup is good. Camera could be better. Overall a good deal..
Body : not slimCamera: Bad qualityProcessor: SlowYou can get much better mobile in this range.I have only regrets,if given the option I would have returned it.
HAPPY WITH M33 .  NICE CELL PHONE.  WITH 5G NETWORK.  AWESOME. I LOVE ALL SAMSUNG GALAXY M SERIES CELL PHONES
Hanging issue, heat problem
Very user friendly with latest technology
Worst battery life
Good Product
Only reason to buy this phone is " not to buy Chinese phones" ,excluding Chinese brands samsung/nokia/HTC/Apple... HTC and Apple above the range and i am not able to handle also. my budget is just 25k..medium speed still with 8GBbattery drains fast even with 6000 capacityno LED notifications(AODnotify)lot of junk samsung apps
We have been facing a charging issue many times. we have two times repaired it under warranty in the Samsung service center every time after a few days of fixing it, the same problem was faced with it.  the phone has automatically detected only fast charging not superfast charging and the mic and speaker sound not working properly.  west of my money after purchasing this phone(Samsung M33). I recommended to everyone, please do not buy any Samsung mobile phones.Rajendra Singh9399558097
Nice
Best Phone In This Budget
I like 👍
Treat this as basic phone with heating problem
Performance of this phone is outstanding, good battery backup, I really love this phone and samsung will make it more effective if it also provided the adaptor along with the handset.
Worst product by samsung. Dual sim dual 5g not available. After one ui 5.0 update 5g is not accessible. Phone gets hang sometimes and restart automatically. Never go for  any samsung products.
Good phone for all future
Its good if they provide the charger, front camera is an average one
Reason behind 5 star this smartphone full fill my all requirements like1. Best Camera2. Best Performance3. A big battery4. 5G smartphone5. Good display
Battery good
Battery  life is  bad badFull charge  Battery  12 hours  v nhi chalta  H😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭Sale charger  v band Kar  DIY H
Phone is good but front camera is not good.heating problem which talk and charge
Go for other company as samsung is not good
Super clarity cam at a very affordable price. All other features are really good for the price. Drawback is u won't get a charger and a earphone if u want one u have to but it separately
Value for Money
Superb
Not good product colour effect is not good and application is not running properly automatically closed problem
Personal use,battery life is good
Very good
1. Excellent look.2. Sturdy feeling3. Premium look and display4.  4 year security update and 2 year os update5. No charger inside which is bad6. Good deal7. Heavy build8. Overall excellent
Poor product and highly priced in name of introductory itself..Samsung is just looting money in making low quality phone, reducing items like headset,  charger and overly pricing for just the handset.  Not worth and quality is completely not up to mark like hearing from handset,  camera, battery.  It should have been priced 12k to get 5 stars
No adapterNo ambled displayHeating phone
Everything was good but i was very dishartened by the main accessory 'Adapter' not included which is the heart of any smartphone.
This is my secondary phone, water 💧 in front side is a big compromise in this price point, but really appreciate the design language of Samsung in back side.
I am happy with my new phone as it's performance is good, value for money and good battery
Finger print is Good quality,Battery  life is too Good.Camera features is Good but front  Quility  is not finally Good but average is Good
Everything is Good. Display also feels good but samsung is known as amoled display provider so samsung should have given amoled display with punch hole notch.
Finger Print takes properly ,battery life for 24 hrs and camera quality is excellent
I didn't get charger two pin and Ear phone! Kindly arrange to prove two pin for charging  otherwise how would I change my phone.
its above average they didn't Provide charging adapter
Good
Finger print reader should be in the back
Good
Good product
best budget branded phone. better available in 5g. thanks samsung and amazon for giving best deal...battery is superb. quality maintained.
simply awesome phone in this budget
Doesn't it make sense for one of the largest phone manufacturers to pack the adapter 'if you are providing a new type of cable'.How do you expect customers to have power adapter for such cables ?Also no cover nothing. Is this Samsung? I am sure gonna stop recommending.Very DISSAPOINTED. Any features that comes to mind vanishes due to the lack of accessories given.It is mandatory to provide a costly item in a way so that it is usable for the customer.
Superb phone and superb camera quality and battery life . I am very much love this product.
Good at this budget
Its bulky as well as heavy in hand so anyone looking for sleek phone stay away from this model. Not so good looking phone as well.
Paking seal is open condition speaker not clear imei number is different I need return this prodect
Everything  well in phone but in 17999/- , you are not provided charger.Very DISSAPOINED 😔
Useless phone
Good product
Good phone
Good mobile to Buy... - Very comfortable in handling - No lagging - Good camera during day time
Overall it's a good phone. Using it from past two days didn't face any lagging issues. Hope it will be the same.
All the features
The design, battery life  and camera quality are all good I am happy with the mobile.
Battery life is like other set, it lasts for average 30 hours, not more than that, finger print reader is working fantastically. Camera quality is good.
M33 is good phone
if you are came from stock android to samsumsung, you feel very less processor speed while switching apps and laggy UI feel
Very good deal I purchase it for my father its really good product on fathers day Ty amazon
Not value for money. THICKNESS IS TOO AND HEAVY IN WEIGHT. NO ADAPTER WITH PHONE MAKE YOU WORRY TO CHARGE. AVOID TO BUY THIS BULKY PHONE 😟
I like it's camera and battery.I have used it for making videos, clicking the pics,listening music and watching the videos.
Poor battery life
Okay
Fingerprint sensor does not work properly.Touchscreen does not work often. Sometime I feel like I have a problem in my finger but actually its touch sensor does not work properly. Returning for this reason.Camera quality is good but better was expected.Batterry backup is very good.After 30-40 minutes of continuous call/video call, I felt heating problem
Accessories are missing.Charger head is missing.No headset provided.
Display is not good, plz improve display
Nice Phone
Phone is good at this price range but not satisfied with the camera.
Smart phone
Nice phone
Mobile running time on very hot and batry backup  not good and charjing timing 3 hour wrong product
Samsung fullfill the promissThe camera quality is superbbattery life is almost 2 days if you are a normal user
The screen size is big which makes it easy to use the mobile. Also, battery life is long and phone does not heats up while charging.
Charger not received.
Didn't expect such low standard phone from Samsung. Screenshot is absolutely impossible.  Volume drops by itself. Functionality of a human figure in home screen is unknown. Is it really required to launch new models when already working models with all perfectly working features n functions available? Disappointed.
Within 1 month, phone started hanging.When any call comes, nothing is displayed on screen so user can not even receive the call.Same problem happened with my previous phone but after 4 years but this phone started showing the issue in less than 1 month
Worst experience i have ever gone through this because features are very different from redmi which I used earlier samsung has many features but it is very failed to give normal features like date time display and call logs and notification style.. and we can't see one call when we are on another call .. no battery indicator when charger get connected worst experience
Not good
This mobile phone very nice all system is very good 👍
Good phone
Mobile is good. touch, camera, sound are good. Happy with the product. Only charger is not providing. If you looking below 20 go for it. I got it at 16k on release day
This is an amazing piece. More worth for the money.Performance, software, battery life, camera, work profile, safety, security - all decent, within the budget.
Best phone in this price range . The fingerprint sensor is so smooth love the phone . Thanks Samsung
I’ll only say 
Phone battery life is good send performance is ver good.
This mobile total wastage of money. I never thought such a big company product could be such quality. Finger print quality vetmry poor. After many attemps works. Same situation for screen lock. I am only fb and youtube user no one game installed in mobile but still facing hanging issue
Awesome mobile
I dislike the sim tray. Not smooth while pushing the tray in.So rough and looks worn out unlike the smooth finish trays of other phones.
I am not satisfied with this product. The major drawback is low sound. Low network reception with all providers. Utter nuisance phone. Causes mental trauma by call breaking after few seconds. Waste of moneyRingtone...call voice....media voice....audible only if we put it at maximum.Camera not satisfactory.Battery life is good.
Worst product ever seen. In one week mother board problem detected. Given in service center for replacement. Samsung did not replaced it, they gave me samsung coupons of my mobile value I.e. 17999 Rs. This coupon you can not redeem online. To redeem this coupon you have to visit local samsung gallary. Local samsung gallary did not deal in M series. They forced me to buy A series. For same specification of MSeries , I have to pay 6000 Rs. More. Samsung customer care also did not supported me in this issue.I did not use mobile for a week and I have to pay 6000 Rs extra for mobile.Dont buy Samsung phone they are looting to customers. Even call center guy told ne that you purchased mobile from Amazon so you are facing this issue. If you purchased it from local market you will never face this issue.So i request u guys dont buy Samsung phones and if you want to buy it, dont buy it from amazon.
Highly quality phone.
Solid and robust phone with good cam, excellent battery life and great memory. Added advantage - two SIM cards PLUS memory card.
Like fingerprint reader, battery life.
Its very handi phone, no problem in day to daily life, i am using for a month,  all can try its very fast phone...
Phone is affordable in these price
Price is more not value for money I will paid 17100 rupees17100 I paid this'll mobile No charger given. And Frant camera single. Screen guard not given. Sound quality not a good dabha Sound in the mobile I feel very bad Sound in this 😕 mobile. No bass No trubel .No chilling sound old  Dabha audio totally waste.pls don't buy buyer s.
Software hanging and heating issue. Those who slightly phone using person for them OK.
Great colour and amazing phone.
Several sound related issues like buzzing sound during call. Mobile was hung while playing video and sound continued even after exiting youtube. Echo sound and disturbance in sound while playing songs. Disappointing purchase experience 😞
Fingerprint is very fast . Battery will last you 1 day easily with a moderate usgae . Camery i say is good selfie camera needs samll improvements
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G doesnt come with charger. So i tried with my another cable but it doesn't charge well. I have to purchase dedicated charger for M33 and wait till it come. But by the time; you get charger; your  phone return time will expire. So smart Amazon and Samsung Galaxy both. Who doesnt give charger with phone? How would you test if phone is charging or not? Better Amazon send person with charger to test so that we can buy which charger will work.
Nice product. I like it
Same issue
After 3 months of use, still figuring out, how battery life can be improved... Absolutely poor battery backup. Overnight when phone is not in use you lose 12-15%, with extremely minimal use (just a couple of calls here and there, with not much browsing hardly about 15-20 mins a day and nothing else) battery goes down in 2 days. Hope Samsung does something about this...
Harsh sonaiya
It works for 2 days for me when fully charged. Awesome call clarity and experience even in weak network as it has technology. Ramplus is plus point. Worth for money.
I purchase it on very first day of its launch. The mobile looks nice and sleak. It feels solid while holding. Battery is good. Dilevered on time.Disappointed because charger is not included.
1) Mobile get hot by normal use only. Cooling technology of the device is just for name sake.2) Battery life also gets low easily.
Camera quality is very good quality
Battery
Supper efficient Brand Quality Product
Good
Company says this phone is 5G gaming mobile but display response is delayed, many times not supporting wifi, and 4G mobile data.
Superb mobile
Frequently lags and battery getting fast discharge
Just dont buy Samsung until they provide all accessories including air buds
The performance is very poor. Ram management is very bad. Battery drains very quickly and it doesn't perform like 6000mah. Travel Adapter is not included in the box. If the travel adapter is not included they should want to give some discount to purchase the new adapter for the M33 5g buyers right, but they are not giving. I have contacted both Amazon and Samsung regarding discount for adapter who purchased M33 5g device and they are not ready to reduce 1 Rupees from MRP. This phone is not worth for 17k. I'm very disappointed. Thank you Amazon and Samsung for this worst phone.And the final part is, in the invoice the IMEI number is not mentioned. Without IMEI number, I don't know how can I claim the Warranty. I have checked with Amazon customer support but they are useless and not helping in this issue. I have contacted Samsung support they said, Without IMEI number warranty claim is not possible. Finally I felt that even i purchased the Chinese mobile i will have warranty for 1 year.. very verst worst service.
One of the best best Samsung smartphones within this price range . Would totally recommend it !!
Nice phone
Fingerprint reader almost good, battery life superb and camera quality too superbAlmost superb performance,,Nice productlove samsung
Good Phone with future ready features.....Now only waiting for 5g to launch in india....Hope it come out soon...
Camera quality is very good
The Samsung M33 5G mobile is very beautifully designed, I use this mobile for games,social media and all other day to day activities.
😁😅😊
Superb
Good 👍
Excellent craftmanship & superb technology at an affordable price.But travel charger should have been provided in boxGets little hot at timesLook : 4/5Audio :3.5/5Features :4/5Price : 5/5
Battery draining fast. Sim network issue
Everything is nice battery camera and finger, speed working, but adapter will cost around 1500 for you that is the issue.
All is well . Just the side edge is very visible .. and front camera quality is not that good
Good safety features offered by Samsung. battery life is not upto mark. No power adoptor provided. Would have been great if 18watt adoptor was provided with the phone.
Some wat goodProcess is just average
Jus awsome
All good
Highly recommended
it is worth at this prize
Excellent speed with 6 GB RAM, long battery life 6000 mAh capacity, advanced features like 5G connectivity, Unbeatable internal storage..all features at economy..
Best phone for Android users with affordable price go for it
It looks nice and works flawless...its been a month or 2 and no issues with it .Loving it
h7g7
Awesome
Nice
Excellent
M33 5g was good.loved the camera quality and fingerprint sensor and screen was so fast...only the defect is my cable wire it broke in just 2 weeks.
Really awesome experience through it's innovation
Value for money
Everything well in phone but in 17999/- , you are not provided charger.Very DISSAPOINED 😔Otherwise superb phone liked very much
Donot waste money
Performance.
Positive Points:Voice Focus, 5G, 16GB VRAM, 128GB ROM, 2.4 GHz, 6000 mAh 25W Type C2C Fast & Reverse Charging, 50MP, 16.73cm* FHD+ TFT Gorilla GlassNegative Points:Had to buy "Samsung 25W Type C Travel Adapter" separately.
The battery life is excellent, living up to its 6000mah spec. By the time it took for this phone to reach 29%, my galaxy note had to be charged thrice already.However I am obliged to write a negative review. I purchased this phone out of necessity last week. Lo and behold this week the price has suddenly reduced by Rs 5000. If your price will fluctuate so much by such a massive amount, you should provide price guarantee. I feel cheated.
Love it absolutely good and the phone is worth the money
Charger was not given with this product. Very cheap idea
Poor performence, specialy camra quality very lowest, dont buy save your money
I know they should include charger but you can get feel of iPhone and purchase by your own self. As prize point of view, it good buy. Samsung ❤️
Battery life is Good and Camera is fantastic with its amazing AI
I liked battery and software
I'm really happy with battery backup.
Charger adopter missing
Don't but this model
I wouldn't  think this mobile will be this much powerfull and has la good performance and batter best under this budget
Looks Good
Total phone is good
But, my device displayed glass broke
Best in the class and worth for money.
Mast
Value for money product
I bought this phone on the 6th of February 2023, after using it for 5 days. Now I am writing this review.camera = camera quality is very goodbattery life = good in this range but fast charging is not too fast.performance = performance is ok, this phone is not for gamers, this is only for normal users. you can play games but don't expect high performance.network connectivity = generally I travel in the metro on a daily basis so while traveling in the metro internet connection is also good may be this because of the 5g connection. 5g provides up to 70 megabytes of downloading speed.I bought this phone only for battery backup and strong network connectivity and a 5g phone and this phone fully supports these features.
Posative:Good phoneExcellent batteryExcellent buildExcellent OneUIGood displayGood connectivityGood cameraNegative:Average pricingNo chargerWaterdrop notch
Everything is very good
Nice
😐😏😊
Technically good quality product, I am satisfied with this product.
Good battery life, latest Android and future updates, Happy with the buy
Very good quality apps installation too fast lot of options are there liked very much thanks to samsung
Good battery life
Good phone
The phone is not working properly and the brand and reputation of Samsung is turnished by such a poor item, I am really sorry to write but it is a cheating, i never by any phone online now.
Camera is very nice battery also good
Camera quality not good wate,8+8=16 gb ram not showing,and processor not showing,fingerprint not working properly,and showing Android 12 but not that much options and threefinger screenshot not there and full screen option not there minimum not fulfil specification samsung  m33 5g waste of time to m33 phone better to go for another brand.
Overall the  galaxy m33 phone is  very  nice. It would have been better if  supported charger is included in the  box.
Battery life and Camera is very good feature of this phone.
Great phone, pretty fast, decent camera, good display but needs to be brighter outside. Overall a great phone in this price range.
All good
Every thing good
Feature like battery life , camera , fingerprint reader is very good. Charger, earphone  was missing it was shocking
Nice
1. Fantastic Display.2. Very good call quality.3. Excellent RAM management.4. Very fast phone.5. Battery performance excellent.6. Camera performace moderate.
It could be a good choice. 5g phone with such good features at this price range is indeed a good choice.
Nice phone
Excellent Product!
Best android phone in very reasonable price. Finger sensor and camera is very good. I recommend this product to others.
Battery wrost or may be particularly this phonr battery defective.
Good Mobile 🙂😊 😌😊
Very good product
Camera is awesome...Samsung lover always
Nice camera 📷 and battery  🔋  is long lasting.  And performance is awesome 👌. After a long time  Samsung gives a good phone.
Super phone
Battery life is good along with good camera quality and features such as 120hz display
It was very nice 👍 experience with this phone 📱
Performance is not good slow processing,hang, app open slow
Travel adopter not givenThen how to charge the device without adopter what kind of product accessories you have given i have not seen this kind of product this is the most wrost and dislike
Had big challenge in configuring the phone . The password was not getting updated and therefore after restarting the phone , it could not be unlockedHaving tried most of the othet brands , this is the 2nd phone of Samsung where I am facing issue in the overall user experience
This mobile was a complete wasteIt says that it was a gaming mobileBut, when i tried to play BGMI there is no HD graphics and there is no Ultra frame rateI bought this mobile only for BGMI but i regret for that i bought  this mobile
Nice phone. Plz don't worry about the adapter. You can just buy it from outside, or use any old charger that suits it.
Fingerprint reader is easy to use and camera resolution is very good. Excellent product in this price range. Got 3000 discount for exchanging the old phone.
Excellent phone, except for little bit heating issues despite power cooling technology.
The cell phone appears to be good but it is not opening and it is asking for 4 digital pin number. So please provide me the pin number.
Very nice
Just if front cam 13 mp it's awesome
Good product
Over all phone is ok. But network strength is very poor. It will show full network signal in mobile but phone will not load the data. In same place with same network another phone is having very good internet speed. I am fed up with the data speed in this mobile. Very very poor.Camera, display , battery , UI , speaker all other things are ok.Very very bad phone
Overall phone was outstanding compare to other mobiles in the market. Battery backup is too good and camera quality is excellent. Value for money
I bought this phone for my mother who use Samsung phone regularly.the finger touch,the processor and camera are fabulous and user friendly for elderly people
Very nice
I brought it for my Son.. and he's happy with it..
Very good for everyday basic uses. Great power backup
Phone has good battery life. It also have best display. Design and in hand feel is nice. Great camera quality
Love it
Screen is lcd and not amoled. M32 previous version was amoled. Amazing samsung. Its all dark even in auto brightness under sunlight. Pathetic.
The camera quality and features are great.The movement is very smooth, no lagging.The fingerprint reader is also quit responsive.Therefore, an amazing phone.
Mobile weight is little heavy.
Good
Very good product battery life is good camera quality good
Poor operating speed despite 8GB ram. Also takes time to sync with internet
I didn't like additional  sets of Samsung  galaxy  apps , rest all are good enough.
Everything is good
Very good mobile phone.
Everything is awesome but selfie camera atleast should have been 16mp but still 8mp is OK with but if 16mp than it's ultimate.
The Mobile was dead suddenly and I was not able to switch jt on it. When i opt for warranty service, the Company said there are scratches on screen hence it's out of warranty service however there were no scratches on the screen. No boday was cooperating from the Samsung side and they don't care about customerat all. If mobile is sold thereafter they won't take any responsibility for this. Thereafter I told them to repair on chargeble basis so they asked me repair charges more than the mobile cost. I suggest everyone don't buy any mobile of samsung since the services are very poor.
Extra in weight ....
The camera quality was very good. It surprised me as it was above my expectations.
This Product is Amazing features with mid price and i love to it this feature Phone and 5g Technology is awesome
not worthy, except auto call record
Adapter is not available in the box . product is good but not best'
I don’t have any complaints about the processor, this is a good processor but the problem is, that the phone has eMMC storage
Good product to buy with.This is value buying
Phone  is very good ,they have to provide charger also its good iwill  buy out side  it's cost 1600Rs  it's very  b
Camera Quality is good. But it's a bit on heavier side weight wise.
Battery life is not upto the mark, what claimed by company and 8 GB RAM performance is also not meet the expectation,infact its quite slow for regular use also.
Phone getting Network issues as well mobile not working properly while  using phone getting strucked. after strucking phone cant able to restart...  worst phone i had ever since .please take it this problem very seriously get back to me after seeing this valuable feed back.
Good mobile
Face recognition is not upto mark also issue with wifi speed
Samsung trust
I bought this mobile for my mom, its a pretty decent mobile at this price range. The mobile really looks amazing.
THE NEW SAMSUNG M 33 5G PHONE IS EXCELLENT . SAMSUNG HAS GIVEN ALL THE BEST  FEATURES IN THIS PHONE AT GOOD PRICE.
Nil
Nice performance .... Good for our Uncles, Parentss because they use neetly  :)
nice phone
It is better choice for photographic and videography skills,while our best cheap phone and best mid-range
All r good 👍
Battery backup :- very goodCamera :- excellentMultitasking :-no issue at all.Must buy for mid range 5g phone 📱ThanksVidya Bhushan
Although the phone looks like a decent performer, after the latest SW updates, call functionality is gone, i.e. we can't hear anything from other side and other side can't hear us. If the basic functionality of a phone is broken, then it shouldnt be marketed as a phone. Didn't expect this bad quality from SS.
Ignore the charger n display, and see the performance and specifications with the trust of samsungat this much cost, a worth it product...
Ye mobile mat lena bahut hi gatiya hai,
Samsung I always admired but this is not what his time i got from Samsung. I would suggest go for some other phone rather than this. Camera quality is worst both selfie and rear. The overall performance is not satisfying.
It doesn't come with charger...as it was already declared by samsung.Decent Camera quality.Great perfomance in this price segment.I am fully satisfied...got what i needed.
Do not buy very slow system Bluetooth problem
Battery drains faster as compared to Samsung M21. Need to increase atleast 16 MP for selfie. Overall product is good.
Purchased in April, the phone is completd dead now.. everytime there is a pop error of overheating and automatically shuts down the phone. Can't use now.Very heavy phone , overheating.This phone is completely useless
In all expectations Mobile phone is stand out. If you want to purchase just go for it. Don't waste your time to think about.
All functions are not so good as i expected. Camera quality is very poor. Sound also not in control.
Not satisfied  with samsung M33
Good phone easy to use. And fast
Low fast than m31 ,Some time heat 4 file use or more
I liked it and loved its edged fingerprint scanner, awesome battery life and best of class camera qauality.
No charger..no silicon back cover...no headphones...nothing jst a mobile phone...not happy with d packaging... incomplete packings...
Good for all parameter
Product is over priced. Phone lags and performance is not up to the mark. Below average product. Better options from other brands are available at same price.
Excellent Feature in Low Budget a Branded Handed Set Provided, Happy to Buy The Product Good One...

Quality of camera is not good and screen feels out dated with TFT screen and water drop notch and very thik 9 plus mmDiscount is also fraud u need to purchase charger and for EMI u are charged interest.
Very good
Popping ads maybe a dissatisfaction.  But on the whole a best phone for the price.  Easy to use.
The M335G has all the required features which advance smartphone should have.. the front camera is not so good
Fingerprint average reader battery average camera good not heat while phone using examples 8 gb ram 16 gb ram not showing
Display is good. Weight of phone is also not feel heavy. I am satisfied with phone. Software and samsung services are good.

compact and comfortable and good looking
Coman man phone
Valueless for moneyyyy
Amazon वाले फोन तो दे देते हैं पर फोन को चार्ज करने के लिए शायद चार्जर देना भूल जाते हैं
As usual, Samsung display is too good and navigation and sound quality is excellent
Samsung adapter isn't given along with mobile.
I am not able to hear the caller when I recieve calls
Very nice phone to have...stock android OS, battery life is excellent. Runs like butter
It's excellent I liked the phone to much and the camera 📸 is the best part of the mobile
Good phone, very smooth tough .
Price higher, but product is awesome performance
Excellent product
The built quality of the phone is awesome and battery life is good
Good battery, Good screen size, Good Camera's, 120hz refresh rate,& 5g mobile phone
Good display, battery life and other features meet the price defined
Phone performance is very slow and not recommended to buy this phone.
Nice phone
Nice product.Good processor,Nice cooling system,only one major problem is there is no adapter given.But overall the phone is very Nice.Thanks Amazon and Samsung.
Yoo
Good
Battery is good,Camera is decent,Performance is good.
Nice phone for the budget spent. According to me It's an all rounder 5g phone under 20k. The exynos processor is well optimised. Big display phone.
Good battery life...gets charged fast.
The battery life, fingerprint reader and camera quality were of superior quality. Enjoyed using this phone.
Worth purchase for this price
Poor screen, yellow tinge, sharpness missing. LCD !! Not worth the price.
Everything good except finger print sensor as it do not work Ll the time
It is good experience tobusing this 📱.
Battery issue camera quality not worthCompany like Samsung foolling people by not giving charger
Value for money, best in class in it's segment monster battery life crisp display with good refresh rate
Nice Phone, worth to money
Found this phone really superb at this price range. Would recommend others to purchase this.
The battery life is excellent. The camera is very good. It's worth buying for this budget
Almost everything...👍
Excellent
Like this phone features
Camera quality in night is disaster. Not able to capture good photo and video in low light.And battery isn't last for 2 days. Drains in one day and very heavy in weight looks like old age phones. After 3 months of use it stop supporting fast charging.
I am writing this after using the phone for 3 days. The phone is having heating issues and battery is getting drained in few hours..very poor quality phone. I wanted a replacement product, you know what Amazon never cared for my worst experience.  They did not give me replacement. Truly unhappy and do not recommend this to anyone..lost Rs 21000..Amazon I will never trust you again ever. 😔
very good build quality,long lasting battery life,decent camera.
Icon to reduce in size. ...As we are going to Setting, then Home Screen , but No Home Screen Grid or App Screen grid displayed, like all other models in Samsung. Pl clearify.
Overall the quality is good
Finger print sensor, Battery life and Camera good quality
Good
Working performance v. Good ,I have buy this phone last 4 day and till now it's fall down 2 time and till now no problem
Fingerprint reader is not working properly,good battery life camera quality is also good
Good mobile phone..
I am still learning about the mobile phone. Lot of good features so far!
Camera quality is not betterIt’s okay
Very good product in compactable price , i would like to suggest to buy it
Handset is very handy
Best in segment..good day to day usage experience..good battery life...120hz screen  is very smooth
Great product!
Worth buy at 15K
I dislike that app hang and not responding like angel one and online live television via web browser
Battery backup  is good for me. Charger should be included with product. Purchased from Samsung which is extra cost.
Nothing
Good cameraGood fingerprintLong life bettery
Nice
Lovely to buy the product...I love my phone
I like it
Phone is of low build quality, it performs very slow compare to my existing poco M2 6gb 128gb. Lags in very action scrolling, app search. Display is of very bad quality, very bad contrast poco M2 has better display. Or any phone with IPS display would feel better than this. Waste of money. Collects lot of data and no way to stop. Phone do not start until you their samsung conditions. After buying either you throw your phone or accept their conditions. Very unethical company. 5200mb ram for 6gb whereas poco M2 has 5800mb ram. I am first and last time buyer of samsung. Would have brought poco m4 5g instead of this. Lot of background samsung services keep running and cannot stop them without root.
Display goes off suddenly. Unreliable
Very good phone, easy to use, good service, already we use many samsung phones
Very good
Camera quality is badCharger not included in boxHeating problemBattery backup is goodScreen is goodFocus on voice is not working properlyThe final results trulyPlease don't buy this phone rest of your choice
I liked the phone very much.Fingerprint sensor is good.Good battery performance. Camera,excellent photography camera
Camera may be equivalent to M31 i.e 64 MP, which I am using already and charger may be included.
As per the samsung name camera is really very poor....even if you compare to m31... m33 is not at all recommend . M 31 has much better camera. Please check out the specifications before purchase. Otherwise disappoint will be for sure. Don't think it's next level of m31 it's degraded level in camera aspect.
Good product
A sleek and good looking phone at the best price. Go to have feature loaded and long lasting battery.
Crystal clear display,  fast, amazing sound quality
Dislike
The phone is amazing. The fingerprint scanner is fast. The camera is amazing. And The battery is good too.
Nice color n photo features like eraser something unique also ram plus is also new thing that I have heard off....
Is mobile mein Na to charger mila hai na to mobile ki khabar Mili hui hai na koi aur kaun hai
Bought it on the release date, was having a doubt but the performance wise is everything  good till today.
Irritating phone tuch not worth of 10k iam reviewing after using 35 days of usage my advice to all people who are going with samgung A33 5G MOBILE
The phone is very slow and you will realize this after using 2 - 3 months time. App takes lot of time for opening and sometime you need to restart the phone for opening the app. My old iPhone having 2 gb memory works better than this. Really disappointed after purchase.
Company forcing customer to buy charging adaptor @ 1150 separtely.new technique followed to show best phone at low price
Good battery life
Slowness in performance and camera quality is ok
Everything I disliked except display. The camera is pathetic. Battery is not as good as it’s competitors. Processing speed is slow and the sound quality is sub standard
Fingerprint reader, battery life, camera quality, sound quality is really very good.
Fingerprint is not upto the mark.Everything else is good compared to the price .I bought at 15k, the 8gb version awesome deal
Good
mobile have no charger,and not proper data cable,how could we charge mobile without a charger???Charger hi gayab kar diya agali baar mobile gayab kar dena
Heating up abnormally very high. Finger and face unlock not working.I am fan of Samsung but this time i am very much hurted.
Good. Battery performance is good. Well featured. Value for money. No doubt a good purchase in moderate range. Sound quality is good.
Camera quality is not good, it is not worth for Rs. 24000 with offer price  we got it for 15000 but even this phone is not worth for 15k, if you guys wanted for better battery and for storage purpose you can go for it.
Completely it's a worthless mobile as it performs very poor. I suggest not to buy sumsung mobiles after using this. Hanging, No clarity of pics, in every aspect it's a huge mistake to buy it.
Good feature rich phone.  Great battery backup.  Enjoyed using it
Very nice UI design and Long Battery Backup and Front Cam only some what disappointed.
Product is good like m42 Samsung .Audio and video quality is good
Finger print reader and  Camera quality are good and easy to use .
Nothing to like. Single speaker, no charger, poor camera , no super amoled screen. Just for regular use. No great features.
Nice phone with very good features in reasonable price
Monster battery, android 12, 4 years security updates.....one of the latest mobile phones.
laggy phone in this budget
I was using m31 before..It's was far better than m33 , fed up of this bad phone .. battery drains & started hangs sometime.Please don't buy this mobile ( m33 8gb & 128 )
Speaker too low
I like smoothness of touch..
Finger print ok battery life one day Camara quality is good
The most worst thing is not provided any travel adapter / USB charger cable.
Display is top class, camera is also good. One draw back is not providing  a charger nor a back pouch .
Just ok not best since smoothness is not better then other mobile with similar configuration. Not advisable to buy.
Camera and screen quality is not satisfactory, Worst product received. Total waste of Money Fake commitment by Samsung/Amazon,Also Amazon Engineer Visited my place to check the issue,and found the camera faulty and reported it Amazon,still Amazon rejected to refund the money.
I am quite happy with the phone, feature rich for the price range with good quality.
This phone is excellent with 5 nm chip and is very responsive. Screen of Samsung is incomparable to others.
RAM doesn't feel like 6+6GB as they claim. Apps load too slow. Can't play games because of thermal issues.Good back cam, good battery.
I think this is mobile  6000Amh battery not given company Battery life just 4000Amh battery system running west for money this mobile don't take this mobile
Received my phone today. I wouldn't suggest to go for it.. not worth it at all.Cons.1. Poor Camera Quality2. Poor Video Display Quality3. Very Heavy in weightCamera and Video are the first features. Selfie Camera pics looks like a old VGA Camera..  reminds me the Quality of old small feature phone. Video Quality on even youtube is vert bad.Was having high hopes from Samsung but disappointed  badly.
Good phone.
Wonderful gadget! It would be better if Samsung had provided the adapter.. Overall a good smartphone! Camera is awesome!
Nice
Size is very small
its speaker volume is low, performance is not good, and some of the WhatsApp features do not work.
I disliked the camera of the device . Battery is fine
Very good mobile
The mobile has charging issues, the mobile has to be restarted to start charging .Call dialing is very slow .These are major issues .
After 15 days use some cons are in phone as traditional samsung phone lags sometimes,camera is not much good specially front camera is very dull, overall phone is below average
Good product
Good mobile with fingerprint reader, battery life and canera quality.
Product worth
Worst..and return process also worst.
Phone is working all good.
Without charging we can use for 1 day .
One of the best mid range device with superb security , blazing fast User interface and a very good battery.
After use of 3 days. Battery very weak. In 2 hours it goes down. Screen becomes black sometime. Sometime apps like hotstar or Netflix behaves abnormally as touch will not work.not sure it's app issue or phone issue. Processing is poor. Not good phone in 20k range. Samsung phone are loosing quality. This is second phone I am facing issue the earlier was Samsung M31s whose motherboard died in 18 months. Of 20-25k you cannot give good phone then Samsung should stop builting phones.Adding some more :Either you are using fast charger or slow there is hardly difference: For fast charger 3 hours total time to complete charging. For slow charger 3 hours 15 to 20 min.
In description,  it has power cool technology but, i think there is no that type of technology because, my mobile is over heating
the build of the phone s very good and performance is upto the mark. For this price it delivers better than expected
Good qualityWorth the moneyI am planning to buy one more for family
Awesome battery backup and nice phone. 😊
Worst company ever. Charger not providing. Data cables provided, that also both sides c types, how we can connect our adaptor. Again extra burden for buying adaptor. Useless
Nice
I upgraded from Samsung A50 to Samsung M33 5g supported and works really faster specially compared to the old one
Value for money
Nice Product Value for money 👍
A very light weighted phone easy to carry and full of fantastic features.
This phone is excellent on battery life.Very good in Camera. Excellent in connectivity & network speed.
the  camera focus and camera switching mechanism is magnificent.
I am not like this phone, camera quality is poor, battery backup is also not good.
Samsung is best
The features in the new model is awesome and Camera is incredible
The ui of the good.Camera & video quality is good with 50mp & uhd 30
I've ordered this phone right on the first day of launch considering it to be a better version and upgraded specs than M31 which I am using from last 2 years.Cons and only Cons1. Very very Bulky, feels like holding a slab of Granite in my hand2. Overheats while charging and playing games3. Despite they've provided LCD screen I guess that was in order to Save Battery, however the screen sucks. It's very low in Brightness unlike previous version of M314. Even the Camera is not Good.5. 0 rating for size.6. No charger despite paying 16k7. Samsung installs unwanted applications everytime in your phone when you update8. Worst Display in Samsung M series ever.9. No travel AdapterProsColour is greatUI is just Perfect, user delightful
Very bed
Everything is good except that the phone is a little heavy and bulky
I don’t use the phone much soo I have low usage.. satisfies all my requirements but the phone is too bulky… expected a more decent size easier to carry around.
I like the color gradiant. It is bit drak from photos but still I love it.
No
I couldn't utilise fingerprint facility
Phone is over heated when on mobile data and hang is most common problem in samsung now I regret for purchasing this type of rubbish product in 18000 waste of money
It is a good phone
Samsung is now following iPhone, they are not providing earphones and adapter for charging your phone. Guess Samsung also wants a lawsuit against them, like Apple iPhone.
Its a great phone with good quality camera and good battery lige
Very heavy phone..You will feel pain in your hand an wrist  even after using 10 _ 15 minutes
Good performance, Battery life, Camera
So far so good. Phone works well.
Network problem issue
Mobile is good but charger separate purchase not good
Im writing this review after using my phone Samsung M33 for 10 days. I never expected this worst camera quality from Samsung that too 50MP.Positive: Brand and Light weightNegatives:1) No charging adapter2) Camera quality 50MP quality not matching with  Honor 9N 13+2 MP camera quality.3) If you move little bit it will capture as blur, But I have not found this issue with Mi and Honor phones4) Low light forget about taking picture.5) sometime its becomes slow.I wonder being such great brand how they can release such products into market without testing their feature qualities.
Phone is goodBattery is also Good 6000MAHFront camera clarity not goodOverall  phone good superb design
I am not happy with the  mobile...it's not getting charged ..it is purchase few days before...I need  replacement of this mobile..
Camera , processor, RAM is Awesome and battery is good. Satisfied.
The phone comes with a good camera and plenty of battery.
Excellent product
Not worth the money never to buy Samsung products
Budget friendly yet most advanced and powerful features 👍👍
Almost good
Awesome product
Over all good
Ho
Don't buy, if you are a traveler. i brought from India, used Indian sim first as they advised to remove the country lock. when i reached UAE, country lock not removed. I asked amazon to help me with country code. they said contact Samsung. i contacted Samsung they will charge me AED100 (INR 2100) as service charge for the manufacturing defect from Samsung. They will produce faulty items, then will ask the customer to pay for the defect they created.
Camara & Battery is good but 120 refresh rate not properly working
Wrost camera don't purchase samsungEven charger not included in this consignmentMany more better brand available in this price
I received this mobile on 1-oct-22. It's battery is not charging beyond 50 percent and I am not getting option to talk to amazon customer care rep. They are forwarding me to get it inspected from tech which has already been done
Camera in this phone is so horrible.. please do not buy and waste your money ...
Pros: display, size, glossy finishCons: could have better rear cam
Really good quality phone, high speed internet, good quality camera, good battery life, overall great phone
Heavy weight
Many problem with this phone.- phone getting heat while using internet- using with one hand touch issues- no charger that major drawback because its cost outside around 1000rs
Processor battery design and camera combo best value in this price rangeAn adaptor doesn't matters in this price range
Instrument is hanging too much which is a common issues with the Samsung Brand. Needs Replacement.
The phone LCD get loose from body. Within 2 month these type of problems shown . Battery life not good.
It's charger super fast and last long
it's battery backup is outstanding. And it is very easy to handle... it's specifications is extraordinary.
The best phone that I have used
BEST PHONE ALL FEATURES VERY GOOD NICE CEMRA
Good one, good performance
Good features, nice phone worth buying
The battery life is good and the camera quality is nice
Good to see and easy to operate
Don't buy samsung m33 it is over heating while charging and going outside
Worst mobile  camera worst
Good one within 15K on exchange and bank offers.
Monster battery with very good cameraOverall experience is quite smooth
Good battery life...worth buying
Travel adaptor got purchased separately.not good
Good
Camera quality is adorable and extra ordinary with respect to price and software compatibility.
The product is good. I like it very much
Good
It has just been a month and the phone has started hanging . Further every time to receive or make a call , I have to restart the phone or else there won’t be a voice from the other side.I will sell this phone to cashify
I have now used this for almost 3 weeks now and I can confirm that this phone is NOT really worth it. I bought it after positive experience from my previous buy from this series the M31, what an awesome phone M31 is. but M335G is NOT good, camera is inferior to my M31 and the screen is also inferior, there is more bloatware which you cannot uninstall. Forced update installs more bloatware. beware of spyware included in this that installs "recommended" apps without your consent. The phone is heavy. On the bright side, it is slightly faster than my M31, 120 refresh screen appears silk smooth (but not by that much)Worst of all, it does not come with charger nor earphones, strange omission at this price point.
It's a very good phone.
Message notification and screen shots little bit uncomfortable.
It’s Samsung one of the best performances mobile.
Very nice product
Phone is good in this price range, battery and camera is pretty good.....but it comes without a charger
Batter will be running aroun 2days, camera is nice and screen touch is very effective.
It is working nicely with Indian SIM, but not working with foreign sim.
Display has visible scratchesEdges are not properly finished they are not seamlessTotal waste of moneyVery much disappointed being a samsang phone user for last four years
good
Good
Nice
Battery life is good, value for money, sometimes softwares issues
Good phone
Because more features are given in this range
Its processor quality is good and network connection quality is alos very good
All are working good
Low battery life, gets heated up even while playing audio songs, average camera, stops playing videos for no reason and have to restart the phone to resume watching a video...
If you want a phone with good battery life then go for it
It's a very good 5G smartphone at this price suggesting people to buy it.
Great
Battery is good for moderate user
Good
Bilkul Bakwas performance hai zero Sumsung meri favorite company hai or main har bar yhi soch k leta hu k shayd ye phone to badhia hi hoga but khoon pi liye na iska exchange ka option aata
2or3 time need to read it
Good product.
Best mobile got it in limited deal
Nice productGood qualityTouch very smooth
Average  battery life, processing speed, camera quality. It's heat after 15 min of continuous  screen uses. Contacts load slowly. Low network  speed.
I like big screen and speaker
Have to give adapter in the backage. Its common thing manufacturers have to think, C-C port cannot directly connect to charging socket. Now I need to buy another adapter.
All apse running I n zigzag way,screen not stable,become  dark and off
Worthy
mobile not working and date cable missing
Camera quality is very nice but fingerprint  small issue .
Very bad camera ,bad battery life bad funct
Finger print ,camera & battery quality are good
Did not like the way you guys played with the accessories. You have forced a customer to buy an accessory for no reason. When you could have given a usb cabel to to change the phone atleast but you have given a C type Cabel on both the side and forced a customer to buy a new Cabel or an adapter. Why would a sane person in this competitive world do something like this.
Good products
I like the battery performance, no overheating. Touch, fingerprint, camera quality is excellent.
Perfect phone for a reasonable price. Battery life and camera quality is very Good.
I liked the phone features and Tft display looks very brighter.But didn't like the packaging of Amazon.
Owsm
Perfect
Fine
Really good features and reliable brand as always!
really good phone
Like Overall mobile and dislike camera and processor.
Worst product.
The battery 6000mAh Battery is big false. The charging is exhausting in 12 hours and coming below 20% irrespective usage. The phone is heating up within 15-30 mins usage. don't buy this product and Samsung brand as well.
Worst Samsung mobile phone. Hangs a lot. Poor performance. Camera quality is terrible.
It's not a brand new product. It was used and display broken product
Horrible battery life. Camera is bad. Fingerprint Reader needs many attempts. A bad quality phone
Bad product from samsung, very disappointed.already getting heat,1day use.useless data cable,2point C type,is this price range should give charger.very very much disappointed from samsung..looks also very much bad like old product
- Best Camera- Impressive Battery Life- Beautiful Mystique Green Variant
Good Product
The quality of the screen, battery is really good in this price range
Fingerprint not good
The phone kit doesn't have charger adapter.  It comes only with Type C to Type C cable. Must purchase charger adapter separately. Which would cost 1,000 Rs extra. Please read the kit contents and then purchase.
Battery life is good, value for money
Unable to make Whatsapp, Skype and other basic apps working, the phone is defective. I would need the product return processed and a refund issued.
Product is damaged in shipping and  heating issues very less battery life didn't expected this from Samsung. And seller is very bad Bina covering ke phone De diya isliye shipping me damage ho gya careless seller stpl.
Budget friendly nice phone
No cover  no screen guard
No pros in this mobile,  even the battery is 6000 mah it doesn't lasts for 5 to 6 hours, after usage of 2 months these are the issues Iam facing1. Over heating while using teams application2. Suddenly mobile is restarting itself3. Lagging while switching from one application to other
Phone is look like aswmmBattery is also goodCamera result is very goodTouch is very superb
It's good
Really good
Good.
Sunday ko deliver hua Hai aur Monday tak Mai pareshan ho gaya hua. ( 2 days review)Pros1. Pata nahiCons1. Heating issue - Kuch bhi na Karo tab bhi heat up hi rahta hai.2. Gaming issue - bhul hi jao Game khelna.Screen hang ho jati hai( 1 to 2 frame rate ho jata hai.)( during call screen hang)3. Battery issue - 6000mah ,my foot.4. Don't  believe  on youtubers( sab paisa kha ke Bana dete hai video)Reality se bahut door hai ye phone. 5nm processor  ka kya karu Mai.
Good battery backup and very good Display size.
Worst display quality, network issue, sound issue
This is very good 5g mobile at this budget. My personal recommendation for this phone.
Good quality
Charger is not given , not amoled display but the experience of the phone is so smooth
Very good battery, good performance. Thanks Samsung
Camera quality is awesome and no hang at all. It's awesome mobile.
One of the best phone configuration available in this category. Overall the phone slim, good holding grip looks good.
The camera is very nice. The built in tech is really nice
I bought by seeing reviews on it. Waste fellows doing reviews by taking money from them. Don't purchase it. Waste of money. And again to buy charger separately for this worst phone. My Redminote6 pro is better than it
Camera clarity, Battery life, Looks, Built quality is good in this budget.
Good phone
Battery life and picture quality of camera are good
The phone is good but the quality of the camera is very bad.
I am reviewing after 26 days hard uses.All performance are best.
Every feature is gud
A decent budget phone with good performance.
Awesome
I like Samsung Mobile phones. This is my 8th mobile phones. Thanks Samsung for making the most user friendly phones.
PPTP VPN Option not available...
Fingerprint  reader is easy to use.
As per company claim there is huge 6000 mah battery but the batter back up is not up to the mark as per I can see
Colour and ease of access with good battery life.
Very well functioning
Features good camera quality awesome and long battery life
Mind blowing product.... Battery life is better and also very smooth to use
Everything else is Pro the only con is camera quality could be better.
Third party app calls not ringing on leaving the phone idle for long time.The customer care and the service center don't have any solution for it they just update the software and say their phone is not having this issue as it is also samsung.Samsung should fix the issues with it's phone before selling them.Go for other companies like one plus and poco for this range.Don't buy samsung otherwise you will be left with a defective phone with no solution.
It's battery backup are sufficient for 2-3 days
A really good phone worth purchasing
good
All is working very good
Real nice phone and battery backup, I was looking for this, Thanks Samsung
Except for the charger which did not come with box, the phone is awesome....go for it.
User friendly with latrst technology and look...in comparisonto cost..
Just wow!!!Screen resolution ****Battery backup  *****Camera.  *****Overall.  *****Go for it!
Dislike
Look  security and touch screen
Valuable product in Valuable price
Not possible to upload
Excellent Phone
Nice screen pannel
Excellent product
very nice
Sound quality from speakers, call quality is quite good
Very good at this budget
Good phone with such specs and is value for money for sure
Awesome handset I love it
Battery level is not even enough for a day for simple usages
This is totally cheating with 8GB  RAM please check carefully before and after buyBattery not working like 6000mah it is working for 1days for normal use
Phone heated when normal using like YouTube. And Google search. Seller send tech visit but techician not visited and feedback upload itself by technician. And my phone  heating solution is not solve.  I suggest Don't buy this phone.
Excellent Product Battery Performance is awesome Happy Customer to buy on release Date 10 out 10.
Samsung m33 5G Mentioned 25w Fast Charging but with out Adapter how can count fast charge? It Should Come along with Hand Set only.why Customer has to Buy it Sepearately with Spend of 1200 Rupees?why  not supplying with Adapter ?why selling with out proper Calrity.Falling Down Samsung Image.No Brands Supplying with out Adapter.As a Good Brands need to Supply with Adapter only
If I stop video recording it takes 5to 6 seconds to stop.until that phone is hanging. I had used redmi mobile earlier and then I exchanged that with this phone. It is a worst decision I had taken. Camera quality is 3/5. Battery life is very good. Overall phone performance is very slow. Not worth for money.
The phone is excellent  with good RAM n ROM but inbox have very less accessories like adapter headphone phone case
I ordered 25W super fast adapter 1279rs separately.....only one minusbut M33 5G mobile is very good
Delivered defective mobile and neither even replacing it nor refund the money or fixing the phone.. worst ever service.  Did not expect such a low class service from esteemed company
Phone with good features in this price segment

It's simply superb

Wonderful camera experience.
Very good phone with good camera and good battery life.
Best budget phone
Battery not charging mobile heat always
Too heavy.Slow processer.Takes time to wale up.Camera quality is bad in thisbprice.
What is this, Samsung provides me only mobile phone, NO charger NO cable what is this? Every appliance every gadget provides basic accessory. Even you buy a Chinese electric toy car. They will also provide you charger. But Samsung is providing you phone with cost of rs. 20000 without charger. Ots totally unexpected. You will have to pay rs. 1700 for adaptor and rs. 600 for cable and rs. 400 For plain silicon back cover means phone total price is rs. 22700. But you can easily buy better 5g mobile with charger cable backcover along with 8GB RAM 128 GB Internal Memory @ rs. 18000-19000. So think before purchase
Changer adapter not in box.
Battery and camera good quality

Awesome phone but expected to have a charger,Samsung also comparison to others🤧
I like this product. But you have to supply  adapter also
Heating issue
Nice
Battery life is ok, but front camera very bad quality,samsung phone sam hitting problems, adaptor is not gevin tish is big problem.
Superb phone
Nice value for money 🤑
Meets expectations in all criteria like Battery, Camera, call functions etc...
The camera is exceptional.
Phone is good on this budget, but if we are going to buy charger again add 1500 extra.Which makes it higher cost for this phone
All in Good performance
Don't go for this mobile, finger print sensor is not working properly.  It's too irritating.  Got frustrated after buying this.  It's not slim also.  I am trying to exchange this, but this mobile model is not listing while purchasing a new mobile.
Phone is good but charging adaptor is not there , how to charge the phone without adaptor.Not recommended to buy this product
Excellent product.
Good product
Good mobile in most of the aspects.... Long lasting battery
Good processor no lag, must buy if thinking for mid range mobile
Phone is very heavy. please do compare and consider phone weight before purchase.Also it only supports 25w charger for fast charging. since phone is not shipped with charger, if you are planning to use other Android phone type c charger, it will not be helpful. original 25w charger will cost you rs 1500. so make a informed decision.
Best Product of Samsung...
Very good under this range
It's a good phone
Battery life is quite good, no complaints on quality for this budget, however fingerprint reader is doesn't  sense properly most of the time, this senser may be improved.
I like all features
I like this product

After one month calling speaker not working.
Love Samsung products
Camera quality is good along with good battery backup
Best Phone with slow and worst quality camera. Didn't expect this worst quality rear camera from Samsung. Atleast improve camera quality now with a Software update
Best all together
This product has only one good thing. That is camera. Rest all is below average.
Good
please don't  buy samsung  make mobile.  Because samsung company  is not provide any charge their mobile phone ,this is totally cheating with customer
Samsung has always over heating issues, im not satisfied with this product
heat internet not working properly mobile hangginWifi not working properlyLot of problemsJio sim network issue in this mobile
Worst Phone I have ever used. Phone heating like iron box. even MI phones are better in this context. Its better if we expect nothing from camera. They equipped it with 2 MP depth sensor but pics missing that depth feature.  Main problem with this product  is they are not accepting return. It is actually violation of customer right since they didnt even provided trouble shooting. They boast it as 6000mah battery but it not even withstanding for 16hrs of Normal use. I pray you all that don't buy this phone. You can have a better phone in this price range along with Charger, Screen Guard and  Pouch.
The mobile is always be hanging
Nice mobile. Good 5g mobile.
Because of the missing charger/adapter, unconventional type c to type c cable the overall cost of the product is much higher after considering what a new smartphone user gas to spend. Had samsung given an optional free adapter, we would have believed that Samsung actually wants to save the environment and not milk their fans.In my opinion the cost of the phone prior to any offers should be 13999.Also, the phone does get hot on the top right corner on the back. Moreover, you cannot record calls when wifi calling is enabled. This problem is something Samsung should address and publicly admit for transparency with the users.
Due this phone I am not able to send sms na use phonephe or Google pay o felt very bad
Osm camera with gud Ram ...great ROM
Excellent phone
Very good camera quality and best rate in 5g phones
Expensive.  Heavy. Lot of blaotware. Very slow for 6GB RAM. 5G doesn't work.
Charge once and use for two days
Look good
Click picher qulaty
Camera and battery
Battery life and camera quality is good but handset is heavy and thick. Difficult to fit in pockets very uncomfortable.
Premium build quality.
There is no adapter in the box , only the usb wire with both end as type C , how am I suppose to charge my phone . Worst phone
Notifications don't swipe out, finger print at the wrong side, phone goes to sleep while it use.. It shows you are offline though the internet works.. The phone doesn't come with a charger..Overall nothing is good apart from the phone's battery..
Phone is ok but charger is too expensive
Worst quality mobile. Keeps hanging and battery backup is too bad even though with large battery. Screen broken though because of fallen on the road. Purchased total protection plan with this mobile and it’s of no use too. They do not entertain at all
Pls don't buy this product as it's heating badly while we are charging it ... smells like something burnt 🔥 inside !Or i thing Amazon has delivered the refurbished product
some measure issue improve camera quality.
Like everything
Please go for it, great product from Samsung.
I liked
Samsung is going in wrong direction if it still goes on Samsung will be no more in front of you know whom
Best phone in less than 20k price range. Great performance and huge battery.
Camera is not working properly this phone doesn't fulfill samsung brand quality the worst phone ever I purchase from Amazon
Sleek design
Touch Screen doesn't work often
Good purchase
ok
I never thought that samsung engineering team is incapble of delivering good products with performance. This model has serious issues with coding and os design. There is a lag when you access each service or even call a number. Looks like the call to each service that you invoke does not return results seamlessly. This model is not worth purchasing. Please test this device once again and release bug fixes. I used andrioid 7 in oppo f5 which was much better than this device performance. Really upset. I thought samsung mobile devices are good.
Everything else is great except screen quality
The best budget 5G phone in range....
Actually we dint get adopter for mobile
The phone look and performance are excellent.
Good battery life with great camera quality
Battery
Slow and hangs
Good
Nice product
Love the product
I was pretty excited to try this one. But what came as a disappointment is that the phone started heating up even during the first set up and that too within 5 minutes of use.At first I thought may be it was due to backups being restored but even after few hours, when I connected to Samsung Charger still it got very hot while charging.Samsung needs to fix the heating issue as soon as possible.
Mystic Green is the color to own
Nice mobile as of now thank you amazon and samsung
Screen Shot is not user free.  Fingerprint side button also little difficult.
This is my 4th samsung phone...and this M33 5g is worst product till date.This phone has certainly reduced brand value of Samsung.If a 6000mh battery needs to be charged twice in a day den samsung should learn a bit of battery knowhow from any other brand...It indeed has reverse charging but for that to function, primary battery should also have some capacity to store charge...After many years I saw VGA quality front camera ...If an 8MP camera has this quality then it should be a matter of investigation...samsung should recall this product or i will have to go for exchange at the earliest..
Product cost is too high with no charger ,very poor camera and it's charging speed is more than 2 hrs for full charge the  cable provided is 60 rs low quality charging cable . The Samsung cmpny started scaming people by showing shiny poops
Awesome product
Battery and camera is excellent
Not received adepter and data cable and cover please send
Voice is not clear in this phone
Even you don't  have trust  in this product  it is not possible  to exchange it  with other phone then why do you sell it in first place
Need to improve  selfie camera
Samsung supaer
Excellent design and features. Phone colors
Best product
Every time network 4g speed low so change it to flight mode than it works
Working good
They say that they have gorilla glass 5 protection in this phone i.e. samsung M33 5g but just after 2 days of purchasing the phone it slipped slightly from my hand and the phone got a crack in bottom right corner as you can see in the picture. Also I went to samsung gallery and there they told me that it wont be covered in warranty and you will have to pay 5100 rupees and all your data will also get erased. Seriously its the last time that I have purchased a samsung phone. Totally hopeless
Biometric n face senser don't work properly. Camera quality not good. Voice  quality is very poor outside the home.
Good performance
I think Amazon not check the product quality.I just unbox switchon the mobile friday. one black spot on the  screen left side corner.
Damaged mobile
Phone is heating rapidly even with the small usage and battery also draining fast
Mobile is heating a lot while using and charging.Good things:performance, is very good speakers, camera, FHD screen all are good.
everything is ok but Heating problem only

Great phone

Shuffling between apps or going back to homescreen takes a few seconds. And same applys to opening apps.
Handset claim Superfast charging but after charging two three times set suddenly stop superfast charging
Posting this after couple of months of usage. Face recognize is pathetic and camera quality is nothing near to 1 star..
Don't take this phone the wrist phone camera not properly working
Battery life too low due to Amoled screen and Android version and hardly works for 24 hours (Excluding screen time). Poor build quality and not as expected from samsung. Color combination quite good.
Very nice looking 👌 5 star *****
mis mach iteam it is old itam already yoused itam
After use if 15 min...phone will be heated...so if u want to buy samsung u can choose m32 of f23..
Camara quality is very bad and processing also slow battery also not satisfied
I have bought one and replaced it due to heating issue. The replaced new one is having the same heating issue.
Best Ever phone in class.
Good product. Worth for money
Good
Mobile phone off while taking photo from mobile phone. The colors are changing and they are becoming the same. Very bad experience in 4 days.
Best phone at best price
Product  is  heating,  while  using  network  and missing  adopter  is a problem.
Battery getting discharged at a rapid pace, despite of very less usage. Camera is ok, not that great. It's been only 2 days, but very much disappointed with the battery performance.
I think I should blame my luck here.After I purchased, the rate was reduced.I had to purchase the charger separately and I spent 1400 extra. But after I purchased, charger is given free.Most of all, my kid dropped the phone on the 2nd day (just fell off at half feet height) and display is broken.I made this phone purchase with a very happy and satisfied mood, everything toppled in a very few days after I received the product.Can't blame anyone other than my luck.
Good
Very good product working good
Storage and battery backup
Most phones which we buy have a charger atleast. They have put a C type cable at both ends with no charger head. So it is not compatible with your existing charger head. Over that they don't provide any backcase like other phones.I bought this phone considering it is stock Android, but it has bloatware and all samsung wear apps which you cannot uninstall.Also you need to accept privacy policy of samsung to install the device, which is not acceptable for stock Android.I don't know why it costs 18k with almost nothing changed from Android view, but added bloatware and removed essential accessories.
Written price 24999. I got it for 15999
Good Phone ane excellent battery life
Awesome 👌
Nice and must buy mobile
Good phone but charger missing
Best  reliable UI experience. Trustworthy brand. Overall good experience.
Loving this phone
Amazing battery power of 6000mah.Powerful exynos 1280 processor
Camera result is poor.Mobile has been received without charger.
Excellent mobile in affordable price
Every thing found ok
This is worst phone i ever used. I trusted samsung but they failed me. So much of heating problem. I can able to feel the heat in hand and not able to hold it and use it for longer because of the heat the phone is producing.. i have requested for a refund but amazon not yet done that. They have said that technician will come and check but they are rescheduling the visit almost 4 times now.. this is not expected from amazon.. please refund the amount.. this is phone is not deserved this amount. Request you to refund the amount.
Using it for 2 months now. Batter really lasts more than two days. Camera quality is decent. You can't discern between LCD and TFT screen. Using 5G on it. Working fine. But while switching from 4g to 5g there is a lag. I think that is from the operator's side. Overall it's a great purchase. Go for it.
Good working
I am fully satisfied used this Samsung M33 5g
It is good as expected from Samsung..👍
Surely recommend  who's going to buy new mobile
Camera - patheticMobile - heats up quite a lot that too very quicklyNot getting a charging brick in the box is a huge headache because the cable given is C to C . So additional 2,000 bucks for after market brickNo back cover in the box which is expected at this priceThe Mobile does not even have a standard screen protecting lamination.Too much cost cutting by the company shamelessly .The actual worth of the product is about 10-12 thousand that too if the customer is being quite generous.
Battery life and screen
Phone is extremely slow. Amazon technician and customer service not helping with replacement or return , they are falsely saying phone is OK which is NOT. Better buy MI phones
Regards
No adapter. Both end of data cable of type c. Seems Samsung has become desperate to earn money from accessories only. Shame brand Samsung.
Liked it
There is no adapter in the box. First earphones are removed now charger also removed. Next mobile will also be removed
No more comments...😒
PRODUCT IS GOOD.. SAMSUNG YOU NAILED IT..
Overall very nice mobile
Best Mobile loved it.
Cons:1. Not providing charger - only C type data cable available2. Audio jack issue(3.5 mm jack), tried multiple earphones but still not able to resolve3. Audio/video fast forward by itself4. Tried to return product but Amazon saying that return facility not available in electronics products5. Amazon scheduled for inspection only6. Better to purchase from local shop.7. Amazon even not accepting my review due to their policy, getting mails that we could not able to get this posted.
Nice one.. happy

Mother board of brand like Samsung gone in just 6 months
Used for two months, then suddenly can feel some burnt smell coming out of the headphone jack and the charging port. The phone was heating up a lot though.
Not satisfied, Samsung poor R&D in 2022, waste of money.
I dislike by me or my friend ls and siblings
No Fast charger adapter was present in the phone box. In the market it costs INR. 1,500/- additional.And now after 1 month of mobile launch, SAMSUNG decided to lower the price of the mobile by giving 1000 rs extra discount to new buyers which is totally unjustified and so depreciated value of the smart phone. Now I can't even return it because the time has gone. Also, the phone has average features compared to the market competitors. Very Sad experience with Samsung... Never going to buy again any samsung smartphone in my life.
Amazon  is a trust worthy side to purchase  everything same product you will received I had using Amazon  app last 8  years.
It's a great
All aspects it is good.
This product was created much hype but the product is of no use poor deployment of operating system. Cannot handle multiple apps very poor not worth money that I have spent. I have no option to request for a product return not refund. I would want to return this and obtain a refund. Our old galaxy j7 nxt and this device is performing at the same speed. Too many bloat ware. We did block and disable and deleted or uninstalled those bloatware but still no use. Pathetic device with pathetic processor and ram. Last but not least pathetic customer service.

There is no charger with the pack and now available with discount on adapters
Good build value for money. :)
I am astonished that samsung released this useless phone at this price range.  Honestly, gone are the days of samsung. I bought a 8GB variant. It even gets stuck when opening launcher, twitter, facebook. Forget Pubg. IDK what's the point of this 8GB RAM and 5nm processor when I can't even open twitter and use it without lag. On Top of that, samsung doesn't provide the charger. This phone charges so slow that it almost took me 3 hours to full charge even with 25w fast charger. Absolutely bad phone. I would skip this phone. This is equivalent to windows 8 if you ask me.
Slow... very slow. Bulky. Not worth even  10k.
Camera is very bad quality
I like this phone
Very good handset
Mobile phone is heating up while charging. Amazon is ready to deliver the order to remote places but not able to send a technician to such locations. Also not ready to give refund. Customer care service is worst that's what I found. . They really don't have capacity to solve the problem. Also didn't expect such type of service from Samsung and Amazon. Waste of money and time. Improve your customer care of Amazon.
Worth product for this price
Nice mobile 📱 value of money
Only drawback is it doesn't contain charger
Best product in this price range. Excellent features

I purchased the phone for its camera and it is an absolute waste of money.Rear and Front camera is like VGA. Pictures are very grainy and looks pixelated.Does not come with an adaptor. And the data cable that comes with it is C type. You cannot charge it until u have a laptop with C pin port or purchase the adaptor separately (which is a trick to make you spend more on the charger)I did not check other features on the phone, so I don't know about other specs.
Noo charger
Nice view
Battery falls down in 20 min from 60% to 20%
Really bad camera, bulky phone with lagging provlem. Never expected this from Samsung.
I love it
Every thing excellent
Really happy with the product.
Good 5g phone with 8 &128 Gb space
Nice Product but little expensive
Charging adaptor is missing,even the cable which is given in the box is no use as both side the same port are there
3rd class Camera quality
My lifetime product - Samsung
Phone is not as per my expectation. It will be like phone of first generation smart phones. Your hand will get pain carrying it. Camera quality is not great. Sound quality is not good. Want to to return mobile, but amazon has stopped products returns, its only doing product replacements.
Nothing
Speakers are very bad.slow sound.battery is exhausted soon.waste of money
It's bit heavy in holding
Its a good phone at this budget

Not satisfied with the products phone hang hone strt ho gya abhi 1 month bhi use nhi hua not worthy don't buy
Awsome phone
It is useful

This is having good 6000 mah battery however phone hangs. Not at all good for people who have online mails etc
It's just aewsome.
Design is super,Display is 120hz is great
Good sound, camera. Faster performance. Decent battery
Don't recommend at all.Breaking voice while attending calls, phone performance also not upto the mark.
Battery charge holding time is very good. Camera quality is very good.
It's good phone
Good to buy
Overall experience is good
Bindass ekdum
waste of money. looks like a basic average phone. I received a cable which had same C-charger heads in both ends!!! Can anybody say what is the use of this cable?? Should I connect one end to my phone and other end to my neighbor's phone???? Samsung says its MRP is 24999 - for such price can't they provide charger??? Wait for other 5 G phones. Do not buy this.
Adapter not provided with the phone , camera quality is pedestrian and phone frequently lags
I love my home
All good
Good phone
Such waste phone. I wasted my 20k on Samsun M33 and after using for a month, the phone is not working now. Every time I try to make a call, it says could not connect. Please do not buy this phone and dnt waste your money and time.
Heating problems it you call video call 15-20 minted then back side heated
Cool feature
Good camera clarity
I libe everything about samsung
Purchased this phone from Amazon . Battery is Draining very Fast.Called many times to Amazon They shift there responsiblity to Samsung  Samsung shift there duty to Samsung Customer care and customer care denied to replace it by saying this is okTheynare just wasting time irritating customer to stick with this peace only .better buy offline so that shopkeeper will help you by any means
Mediatek processor is worst and this made ur phone slow in every sense and doesnt look like a 5G phone.Use only snapdragon processor in every phone.ur this phone is gud but 1 star for mediatek
I'm dislike that product as expected is not for use. It's very slow and same buffering same application. Company charge high amount but product working not improve, please value of money produce.
BATTERY LYF IS GOOD ,CAMERA QUALITY  MAY IMPROVE
Very nice
Money worth product
basically i purchase the Samsung M33 for advance performance and pay accordingly but what i observed after using it one month is just like a basic android phone which was 10 year old generation like basic processesor with kit kat and 512 MB ram 2000 mAH battery so i never recommend it for smart and advance use.
Battery life
Value for money...good features as well
Not good
Very low quality product... A 5000/- rupees phone may better than this 😔 total money and dignity lost
Actually I wouldn't have given a star. Without giving a star I can't review so only I gave this star. Worst part is USB cable only both sides are C type cable only. For laptop we need to buy seperate cable for charging we need to buy seperate adapter for both they are making money.. It's really frustrated . I request u ppl kindly don't buy this .. Worst ever phone
NYC in this budget
Go for it.
Rewriting reviews after using it for 2 months. This mobile is utterly slow and made life hell. It's slower than even my 4 yrs old Motorola g4 phone.Samsung MUST shutdown its research and developmentI bought Samsung F23 and M33. F23 has snapdragon processor which is almost double faster than M33 exynos processor.waste of money. F23 is even cheaper than M33. camera quality is below avg. cheap BBK phones offer much better camera and processing power. One UI is very slow.
No charger, camera quality is not up to markDidnt liked the mobile overall
Good product.
Battery not good. And camera average. You will get better mobile for this price.
At Rs 17000 no charging adaptor provided by  samsung....Neither specification about Compatible charging adaptor  given
6000mh battery but bakep bad
I liked eve
Dont be fools with Samsung Agression Dump of new products, actually they are not worth for money. M33 5G is most creating mobile and bakwas quality in all parameetersDisplay, Sound,  UsabilityI purchased in May 2022, now today 22nd July  2022 it literally irritateme
Phone arrived dead; no replacement available.  Phone arrived dead; no replacement available.

The phone starts automatically. The worse phone I have ever purchased. Don't buy this product.
Multiple issues were faced from the day one onwardsOTT apps not working properly keep on showing errors..Camera not supported pop-up came many times..Sim card not supported most of the time, 2 times already updated sim card.. even update of software also not resolved the issue faced....Samsung care customer technical team taken remote support even though issue can't able to resolve...Please don't go for this product.. it's waste of your valuable time and money......
Don't buy this product not worthy

Good experience
Charger is 2 sides Type C port. How to charge the Mobile using Adapter??
Received defective piece.Sim ejector was not working.Face detection was not workingSpeakers were not workingSim slot had markings which suggests it was already returned by someone.Now amazon wont let me cancel the order and wont give me speedy replacement due to their policies. Stuck with unwanted product.
Donot buy .
Good
Sleek design, glitter back
The phone's overall performance is ok but not the battery backup. Samsung is always struggling with the balance of the app. And apps are consuming high battery on background due to less optimization.

Thanks samsung
I just used this only 2 days and sim card salt not working

Amazing
First of all, camera gives bad quality picture, there are lot of issue I found in this phone at this budget.. you can think twice before it buy.. I suggest think something else not this one , at this price..
Heating issue in very first day 😔. Very worst experience.

Screen brightness not sufficient.4.speaker sound quality below avg.5.too many samsung inbuilt app. U can't disable or uninstall.6.processor also not giving needed speed.Battery is good , camera is ok.
Nice
Average  phone not good.
Don't buy for bussiness purpose, 100% wasteI sale this new mobile for half rate 😡😡😡😡
Ok
Front camera also not satisfied after 3months phone some times hanging
Very bad mobile.Not so good as Vivo phone. Get heated too much while using internet.Lags sometimes
The mobile  shows signals bar without sim cards.It's bulk..No comfort in hands.totally bad product.
Grainy front camera, screen resolution is not showing TRUE Natural color
Not  Recommended.. No adapter, have to buy  the separately.
bad charging time
Also there are lot of Facebook apps/packages running behind even when you have not installed any of the Facebook apps. Also Google Play download apps are auto updated by Samsung Apps Store even when permissions for Samsung App Store is kept off. There are also same data collection stuff going on in background which are used for app suggestions. Please don't consider buying this phone looking at the specs. Buy a phone which has only Stock Android installed.
There is a bug in this phone in wifi connection..
I bought this from samsung website. By looking the ads & presentation from samsung I desperately taken this phone but I got disappointed.Nothing is in this phone as shown in ads, neither body colour same as shown in pics nor the phone is speedy. It hanging and very slow down. In software F22 is much better from this just go for f22 if like the model. It's purely propaganda from samsung about this phone.
Waste
Phone is over heating alot. This may affect board and display later...
Worst product ever bought from AmazonThere is heating issues in the phoneAlso there is no connectivity/ network. More over the customer support is also worst what kind of professionalism is this we buy new phn so that there will be no issues and here its beet 5 days and long hold calls to get my refund back
Performance is very bad. Not expected this from Samsung brand.
After a long time I bought new samasung mobile but I can see it is having heat problem this issue was always there in Samsung but I thought now it might have resolved.I am not happy by taking  this mobile.One more points need to update like camera is not having date dipaly functionality. In MI we used to have same.Battery backup is not good.
Nice
Very bad quality Delevery Amazon
Got a seal broken product, need a replacement for this
Device hanging on first day  itself
Bad phone loss for money
1. Camera quality poor.2. Battery consumption  ok.3. Video quality  poor.4. Touch screen ok.Totally not worth for money.

Plz don't buy guys net chal ta nehi thik se 20 din me hi sell kar diya. Na koie exchange he iska . Pata nehi ye samsung Wale kiyu eeas bana te he.
Totally waste of money and  amazon  is making a harassing policy towards it's reputable customer...becoz once purchased it can't be returned even its faulty .so once bought no u turn ...but to suffer with the daulty device or the device u like or not..
First time on pannumpothe heat aaguthu
Black spot extremely right just on the side of volume low and high key
Good
The fingerprint scanner is a useless side button which is extremely difficult to set up and doesn’t workThe face scanner is useless too , 9/10 times it won’t recognise your face after setting it upThe battery life is very poor and even with minimal use doesn’t last a dayThe phone is a waste of money, go for one plus instead with al great features.. don’t waste money like I did..
Nice mobile
Very very bad product.recomened not to buy.
Mic of the phone is defective. I ordered one then got replaced with other. The other phone worked for 10-15 days and the same problem now with the other phone And the replacement window is over
Network problem
personal use
Love the colour
Just go for it !
After using for more than two months, review is like it's eye sensetive, heavy in weight and some times slow in response. Most important no adapter  with this phone, things look bad. So I am willing to give zero star. Since that is not in option so I am giving one star.
Samsung phones at this price are useless to buy. Not given even a adapter,  shame on Samsung.  Coming to amazon, this is even worse.  Amazon's return policies are horrible now a days , even the mobile was overheating amazon could not arrange successful  return pick up in my case . Overall Samsung m series is a failure I can say.
Overall performance is very good
Decent performance
It's the worst phone ever, waste of money and no use of warranty
Charger not  available
Awesome Phone
Poor battery life though it is 6000 amph, I returned one piece for same reason, but they sent again same piece, very bad experience with Amazon, and sim slot is too delicate
This is pathetic no adaptor, no earphones included. I think samsung is forcing users to buy Chinese brands which provide adaptor. I will recommend to my friends and family to don't go with samsung as they don't provide adaptor and earphones.
I am not happy with the front camera quality its like basic set camera.
Don't buy Samsung phones, the charger doesn't come in the box
Superb
I have already written it
Never use Samsung mobile such product never expected from Amazon/Samsung request you to do the needful.
Overheats in 20 minutes of usage. Which could lead to the smartphone explosion.
Battery life is good
Processor is very slow...Gets hanged multiple times, also screen get unlocked with full bringtness later on adjustes with brightness level you selected with gives problem in night vision..It's an big disappointment from Samsung..
I think I got stuck on buying this phone. The rear camera takes images which are mirror images. The resolution is only 2 MP. Such bad camera in these times is rear. M30 was much better camera wise. but this one is bad. The front camera is 50 MP but the selfie camera is really bad.
I was captivated by it's price and knowing Samsung as a reputable brand decided to purchase this phone. Little did I know that before one buys this phone, they must also have a ₹1500 charger with them. Requesting for a refund is also impossible it seems. So now we're stuck with this item
Not recommended to purchase M33 5G, better to go for other brands.1- Lot of heating2- Hang much on using camera, playing games3- Sometimes touchpad not working properly4- Camera is not upto the mark (low picture quality)5- After replacing the Ist phone, IInd also has the same issues.
No charge adopter, performance not as excepted,
Battery backup worst
Buy this product is worst of money 💰.. Samsung please concern about your product..It's totally bad experience for me
Very disappointed for this product...becoz of hearing speakers are not working on 6th day of purchase...so be careful to purchase and check it out as soon as possible for purchase date...but they give exchange date on 5th june....but speakers are not working on 6th june...so u can decide wat happen on this product...
Finger printer capture not working..5G not working with Airtel and Jio
Nothing like in this phone, everything worst
Phone to mil gya per charger nhi mila plz provide charger
Not worth for money.. No charger in phone
It's been very uneasy to work on this and screen touch is very bad some times it does not work at all
No charger inside  the  box
This is the second time I purchase the sumsang phone and  it really land on the hope of my past experience. Besides having 6GB Ram performance of the phone is very slow due to samsung UI and hangs alot. Also the picture quality of front and back cameras are very poor in low light.I am very much disappointed and want to return the phone.
Like
Never pushing it.
Waste of money
Dislike, hanging problem
SELLER SHOULD HAVE HIGHLIGHTED IN BOLD THAT THERE IS NO CHARGER
Not worth for money 17999 (6GB RAM 128 Internal memory).Cons :No charger adapter. Even given cable is having 2 side type-C, which. Can't be used in other charger adapters.  So we need to buy charger in market around 1000 to 1500 rupees.No headphones.No Amoled display.Camera is average.Pros :Battery backup is good.Light weight and slim in 6000 mah battery range.
REALLY I HAD FULLY DISAPPOINTED FOR THIS PRODUCT.Normal branded mobiles much better than samsung m33 5g mobile.sound clarity and camera quilty both are very worst.RATING: 1.5 / 5  * * - - - / * * * * *
Not good for anything wrong information from export
Delivery very bad because replace item renewed
Within a month and just 30% storage use it is lagging like a 1gb ram phonePatheticNever buyNever trusted samsung beforeN NOW THEY GAVE ME REASON
The mobile freezes a lot. I returned it
I have just unpacked my phone. Hence unable to comment about any of the features. However, the data cable which is received with the phone, does not connect to my laptop or PC. how to use it? Can anyone please advise?
Just after 20 days of usage 3.5mm audio jack/head phone jack has a major issue. Samsung is not willing to solve the problem. They just want to deposit the product in service center and do hit and trials. Samsung customer support is very bad. Amazon return window is also over after 1 week. Now no one is helping me out. Phone has heating issues also. Warranty by manufacturer is for name sake.
Bgjgjdy the ui eh hi hey hi
Very nice product
I have to buy M33 5G last week, but the operating system is very slow and the microphone and speaker is not working properly, don't buy this model,
Battery is draining fast, camera is worst
This is the 2 nd time that phone purchased on Amazon stopped working in a matter of 3 months.
Bahut hi ghatiya mobile hai
After long, I went for SAMSUNG anticipating that it could have improved the speed and efficacy  ....but unfortunately  it's not the value for money. Color visible in PROMO is totally different...NO feel...Other phones of this range may give better results. Feels rough phone in hand. Not recommended  best on my satisfaction...speed is like a old hanged phone....Totally waste of money ...Too heavy in.weight ..Very much disappointed 😞
Colour is good worth buying it.
satisfied
Good
Data is being spent too much and is not working properly.  Hanging problem.
Battery backup not good before using Samsung I am vivo user and Battery backup very good with 4000mh in this product 6000mh Battery but backup very lessMin 2 time recharging require per day
Camera tripple not good but realme camera amazing

Bought it today. Find it cool and smooth. Best features in this budget
Phone will hang after few month, prefer not to opt for this
Did not link with my bank account
Worst phone
I didn't expect this from amazon there no proper description and I attempted to return the product but there is no returning of this product it's such an headache after I bought this productHere after I'm done with this app
Built quality
Battery heats up in 15 mins normal browsing..why
Not working
Ordered this phone hoping something new. Bad experience. Lag problem is persistent.
Not good
I liked it
I don't recommend to buy this phone
Super
Camera 📷 quality is very very poor.  Finger touch is given at side which is not convenient to use
The charging cable is faulty. The adapter doesn't come with the phone so I didn't realized this. When the adapter didn't work, I thought thr adapter was faulty. Meanwhile the return window is closed.How do I replace my charging cable now?
Battery backup very bad and camera is not good fingerprint reader fine
Over heating problem
Microphone has stopped working after 2 months usage, not recommended.
Using since last 20 days, and after that I am writing this review, if you have 20 k to just waste then only but this phone other wise do not think also to buy at all. One of the worst mobile i have eve bought in my life.
The  charger USB terminal is faulty
Not anything New, a typical Samsung phone.📱 Please Don't Buy I am also facing service support issue
Front camera quality very very bad 👎
The phone has become so slow. Have been using it for six months.
I think It could be more better.. doesn't meet the expectations
Hangs a lotUI is very poorly designed
I decided to get this for my wife, as this is 5K cheaper than One Plus nord. Now I regret my decision. She is using for more than a week. Now I couldn't return or do anything.1) Very poor camera2) Phone gets heated up3) Its taking 2.5 hours to charge fully , using the One plus adaptor.
Waste mobile , I hate this mobile
horrible
Less than one day battery backup in normal usage conditions. It's not 6000 mh battery It's 4000 mh battery. I am giving this review  after three days of use.
Without original charger how to use mobile
Thik  thak hai
Hang to much
I didnt receive the charger kindly help me out.
Not as per expected
So bad
Camera is waste quality it is not a proper photo clicking and blowing the photos camera quality is very waste not useful for camera mobile do not buy this mobile for camera usage you can buy this mobile for performance is normal you can buy this mobile phone normal usage will qualities good
Network issues
Unsuitable charging cable has been delivered with the mobile.Both ends of wire are similar.
I purchase M33 1 month ago I m not recommended it's battery not so good it is not backup any I have charge 10 times each day Is there any warranty for new phone I want change my battery if possible pls samsung contact me for my problems solutionThank you!
Wrong side finger print scanner and battery life is shorter
During using the set mob became HOT.  I would like to know the reason and solution
Very  bad  product
The phone is certainly not good for the price.It has very bad quality tft panel and you will always find the display to have blueish tingeThe battery backup is certainly not good considering 6000 mah capacity.You will feel like a cheap android in your hands.Performance is just OK but exynos chipset are never power efficient.
Hanging problem and heating....side finger print reader problem...cam quality is bad...I want refund...
Regret buying
I spend 18k but I am disappointed now as unable to hear voice in calls to both receiver and caller in several times.I did factory resetting and update the phone but again facing same issue......This is not what I expect from Samsung brand...My previous phone is Redmi which I used 4 years continuously without any issues
I like cameraFast chargingSmooth operating
The display of the phone is very bad. The camera is completely useless. I made a mistake in buying this phone
1 video samsung m33 bakvas headset
Please don't buy this phone 📱 i really very disturbed after buy also i will take consumer legal action against samsung and Amazon because these are  cheat with customers
Camera not able to record videos.  Phone is not even able to play videos by any app.It's mistake to purchase this mobile. I started to face this problem in just 15 days.I even went to service center to clear this issue but still facing issues with camera and videos playing app.
USB Cable is not attached with package
No adaptor provided how to charge the phone..
Internet connection automatically disconnected but network full my device
Totally Bad CameraNo ChargerNo HeadphonesNot Good DisplayOnes you buy no refundable, only can replace if your phone is damagedDONT BUYThis kind of policy can Hurt customer, Amazon Should take Refund and Return policy on his every product. I am a Prime Customer of Amazon now I leave it
This has lag in software and very low response time. Not satisfied at all. You will struggle while multitasking better go with other brand like Oppo,bRedmi, realme. To keep price low they have used cheap components which overall results in lag.
Waste of money , the phone keeps heating up , we cannot even play 1080p videos,  increased frame drops while playing games , Exynos 1280 simply sucks very poor from samsungs side , I'm heartbroken
I will never go for Samsung. It shows 6000mah
hanging issue
Battery sahi hai fingerprint bhi sahi hai , processor slow hai, network weak ata hai time leta hai bahut..camera bhi sahi ni hai low light me ya room me normal light me,esse Better oppo Vivo mi hai bs nam2 rah gya hai aur kuch ni hai
every mobile box having charging adapter, but in this mobile box not having charging adapter, this very big unhappy with this product, maybe Samsung also started cost cutting. after purchasing this product again we need to pay around 1500+ for charging adapter. if not providing charging adapter then why can't shell this phone with little low budget.
Not given Charger in box. Such a shame for customer who buy only at name of Samsung brand.  The quality  of front camera  is  not good 8 MP. Can't detect face lock in dark . In giving ₹20000 not getting  proper  features  n quality
Value for Money
Positive:6000m batterySound system is goodLatest androidNegative:No charger provided, all its rivals are providing.Very very slow chargingCamera quality is not that greatMobile lagging sometimes(mostly all apps)Heating issues still there in this modelScreen guard or backcase is expected in box, but they disappointed us.
Without adopter this phone is nothing
Very bad product
Speakers 🔊 Sounds very very bad, songs and you tube watching sound blaring speakers quality very bad, and amazon service also bad. Because I gave the complaint amazon, he still  don't take return,  8 days finished, amazon service very bad
Product is not worthy. After using for 3 months , seen mobile is getting restarted suddenly while using.
Wrost product not working properly and too slow
Heating issue in M33 5G when use camera, Video or AR Zone when phone heats battery drain very fast and phone hang very bad experience totally waste of money. Amazon is not agree to replace the phone or refund money.
The device I have got is defect restart automatically even after guidence given by Samsung service centre. And they claim that batter is 6000 mah but I don't think that it last it's like 4000 mah battery.
very very wrost product westof money
Samsung m33 has 6gb/ 128 gb low battery life
Some time fingerprint not working, battery life is okay or camera quality is okay
Charger 85% above not charging please chenge my phone
Keeps hanging right from first week of usage. Need to restart again and again. While dialing call gets hanged and not able to hear. Screen does not rotate correctly. Touch screeen not very responsive.  Overall not of quality that we expect from Big brand like this.
Fingerprint sensor is not working properly.Front camera is of low qualityPhone is very heavyPerformance of the phone is not that good.
this phone is Very Poor I personay not recomended buy this phone this Overoly Quality is very Poor
Not able to hear voice from other side sometimes hardly in 3 months of buying phone
This phone is absolutely bad, the screen of this phone was made old and bad by amazon, which got damaged after 1 month and I had to pay 5500 in it
I would probably buy it if it was for 2000 and thats it. It is soooo slow and hangs on every screen . I think it should be recalled by samsung and we should be given our money back. This was a total loss . I am already unhappy
Phone heat krta hai
Performance ok display is very poor lcd only, can’t take good pictures  , in this price get other better phones price range and quality better select m32 4gOnce you purchased you cannot return the item there is no return policy unless other wise defective product replace only think about before you purchase
Very bad phone camera not clear, biometric touch not work.
Battry is not good working
Poor appearance No charger provided
Very very dull product of samsung company no battery life no charging support poor quality of this phone
Not good
Two punch holes on hard screen and voice breaks often.
Very less size
Its only 2 months have been using after an update i was unable to use the call option also .Now i have to take it physically to repair .Very pathetic situation.Do not buy samsung phones of this range
Wast of money camera quality  not good main problem is phone getting slow
Worst phone ever..8 gb ram and performance poor than older phone with 3 gb ram... one week and hanging started and that to on normal working. No games ,no official software, no professional working.....bought thus thinking samsung might have changed themselves but they proved me totally wrong. Camera also stops working anytime.
Screen power is low pixle
If you are buying it for the camera.. please don't buy this. It will dissappoint you. This has the worst camera possible on a phone in this range. Only buy it if you are a Samsung fanboy and have more money to waste. Not worth
Just after 24 hours of use, phone stops getting charge.....Seems like seller has delivered a defected item.....Want to return the phone and want my money back......Need a positive assistance from Amazon side.....
Do not support 5G
Please don't purchase this phone. No second space which is available in redmi phone. Only a few applications are allowed to be used as dual apps. NO Charger available in the name of environment. finger print sensor is of bad quality
The phone is extremely bad...extremely slow.. and after 20 days has shown charging issues..it is not charging...one of the worst purchases I have done till now
Not good
Camera not bad and battery very bad
This is an ordinary product which belongs to 10 K range item .. camera is absolutely worse .. battery life is good .. but v have to purchase charging adaptor seperately.. overall not worthy for this 15 to 18 K range .. please don't waste your money
Am redmi user earlier...Not much satisfied with this phone compared with redmi.. Without using (no internet) mobile battery will down upto20%in a day , camera clarity is also ok ok, not satified.. Am using this phone for 1 month. intially figureprint worked, later its not at all working why they given figureprint sensor am not sure...
Heavy weight and low battery life...low quality hardware..phone given to repair in next week only
Samsung galaxy phone use time heat all over bodies
No type c cable
haven't received USB cable
Why only India have a so much heavier phone? LCD Display, audio and processor also a drawback for this price
a device which can't paly 4K video is not worth paying this much price....battery life is decent...lagging performance of phone due to processor and loads of bloatware by Samsung
Like the phone. V good usage. Excellent usage. Can buy product. Camera pics excellent 👌 👏 features are v good
Very bad product dead phone i received its refurbished
India's bekar phone
Worst mobile phone...used to get hang again nd again..
The day when the package arrived camera was not working.As I was leaving the city didn't have time to schedule an inspection by their team.Somehow it was fixed at a service center.Now after 20days speaker not working while taking calls Extremely disappointing.
Power button stopped working in 3 weeks. Without pressing power button options are showing during normal usage. Waste of money
This phone camera clarity not good
Hello,Too worst this mobile. IN every calls first 5-7 second sound not come from my side to opposite caller.Very bad experience in this mobile.
I have found sealed open box
This mobile is very slow and having hanging problem still it having more than 70% space free..
Charjar not avlebul
Camera quality is very very bad.Back camera quality is  like 2_ 3 Mp and front is 0.3 MP.
Mother board issue auto restart problem screen not working.Samsung service centre not proper response

In 15 day unexpectedly the mobile display got completely blank when i reached Samsung service and Samsung customer care both are rejected the approch asked for 5500 rs to replace the display which barand new mobile 15 days old.
Samsung M series is the worst phone ...Phone keeps on restart itself after every 5 min..total money waste..don't buy any Samsung product
Slow Processor, Worst Fingerprint Sensor.
Front Camera Is Too Low Minimum 20MP Camera Is Required,8MP Is Unexpected So If SAMSUNG Get 20 MP In This Phone Then It's A High Profile Phone
Charger not in the packet
Damage product
Software has a lots of issues, mobile HEATING , sms NOT SENT, etc lots of problems.
1. This mobile will hang too much.2. It will be charged very slowly.3. It will be discharged very fastly. I mean if you are using it, within 1.5 to 2 hours it will be discharged.
adopter 25W cost 1500 rs to 2k hence Samsung M32 is better than M33 bcz prize is also high and M32 come with adopter so u may save 4k to go with M32 rather than M33
I prefer to buy a nokia instead of samsung m 335g so much lag ,bugs it becomes hot very fast
Phone is hanging..normal speed and heating and normal
Camera auto flash is not working and it's too much havey phone... please  don't  buy this phone
please don't buy this phone so much lagging please don't buy it waste mobile
No adapter provided ..c banaya Samsung ne..adapter will cost 1700 extra..also phone is getting hang for several times..while using camera it will auto restart..don't buy this product..you will suffer from financial loss if you buy this phone..this phone is not upto the mark also..
As usual the samsung smart have the problem it warm fast and stop working sometimes. At last you have to restart.
Charger should included
No battery life.
Display is very very very poor. Played few videos, noticed it lacks sharpness. Pathetic display. Buying this product will surely disappoint you. Priced at INR17,999 which is not worth. Treat this as I am telling you million times: DON'T BUY.
Normal not very well
Poor
Pls buy this phone very big problem heating this phone like fire very bad experience In sumsung in my life Pls don’t buy
What is the use of type c to c cable it cannot be connected to adopter and not able to charge mobile
My friend using this phone and it's just fine.You people check reviews and buy phone. Amazon sending me mail for review everyday. That's I dropped this message.
Battery quality very poor
Surprised!! Even charger is not with this pack, Highly over priced phone, not work for 17k.. Not good quality cameras, Display is not upto mark, we are fooled by samsung & amazon. Should call back this phone. Not recommended to buy.
Camera
No charging adaptor,no screen guard,no case,no earphone inside,camera quality was poor at night time,face recognition not  detect sometimes, performance was not good,i sold this mobile on cashify in a week,worst experience i never buy samsung again,in 18000 price range better options available.
I written this review after 1 monthTotally waste of money, don't buy M series of samsung,plastic quality very cheap, camera quality not acceptable ,It's 8gb variant, but some time it's hanged
Not worthy, adaptor not available, headphones aslo missing  and duel Sim not working properly. Not value for money and camera has no quality.TFT screen, charging problem, heating problemNothing is good in this phone. Don't waste your money guyes
Display not up to the mark. Sold the phone on the very first day a d took a loss.
Very bad phone very heavy not satisfied at all
Very upset with samsung battery backup .
Performance not good and it producing heat
Mobile mistake
Never go with Samsung M series. Samsung M series is the worst series. They always have motherboard issues. And this phone very heavy as well.
Camera is not that good and phone hangs sometimes within 15 days of purchase only. Back body colour fading in 2 months only. In 6 months, no voice on calling, worst phone ever used.
Adapter and earphones are not provided and type C to C cable is tactics to sell samsung adapter. If a brand is not providing hi speed charger bundled that can be acceptable but a charger is expected to be in the box.
Not at all liked the product. Within 15days of purchase a black line has appeared on the screen. Display issues rising so quick, which means the quality is very poor. Need replacement or refund for this mobile.
Not good, after using 3 months getting issue in software and rebooting automatically very frequently
1st month me ho mobile hang hone laga or app b sahi Nahi chalta support nahi karta bettry backup b sahi nahi hai
Please don't buy this phone. Bakwas
Samsung has disabled the use data while on call feature on this model. It does not have time stamp option in camera.
I had bad experience with samsung phone in the past. I still decided to go for Samsung M33 phone, but it was bad decision. Camera is bad. Phone has heating issues while charging. Samsung, never again I will buy your phone.
Plz don't buy Samsung  M33 5g name change kr diya h bs cheej vhi h bakwas.  Battery 6000mAH h naam ki kaam 2000 mAH ka bhi nhi krti or for front camera 📷  5/10 and 1/10 rear camera 📷
Bed
Heating very fast and battery life  is not good as they sed I a normal user not heavy but it wast and worst for gamer
I ever used this kind of phone. First phone was over weight, it's not feel like 200g. And camera is not worth for 18k.Totally this phone in not value for the money. Plz go for better choice.
They send me an defective item, lm not able to insert the SIM because SIM slot area is not sufficient to insert sim.
Phone has multiple issues, camera quality is average, charger not provided, heating issue, slow response time. Very very very slow phone. Very heavy weighted phone.
Specifications are very good, but Mobile weights is too much difficult to handle for long time, display is very deligate can get cracked very easily with small impact. Sometimes mobile gets slow.
Its not working don't buy this first they takes too much time for delivery still product is not working and if you complain rude behaviour shown by customer service. They just waste your money
Bad phone
Samsung should replace all the customers with better phone, such a disastrarous phone
Difficulty in receiving and making phone calls where there is no wifi network. Can't understand what to do.
mobile heating problem not buy this product 2 mahine ke bad review de raha hun M series cameras quality is very poor
Evrything is good in this price range. But adapter missing. Thays the biggest draw back.And the important point is its not a fast charging phone. Taking minimum 1.15 hr for complete charging.
This phone is hung..
Poor battery life, cooling technology only for ads while it get heat heavily which cause the battery to drop very fast, phone weight is also a concern and sd card error.
Phone hangs within one month of purchase
Phone me ek charger tk nhi add kr skte the upr se setup krte hi phone hang hone lga lowest quality isse km paise me isse AChha phone mil skta h camera is so cheap
For 6000mh battery. It should come atleast for 2 days. Even with the simple apps, battery  is draining like anything. Don't buy this phone. No adapter included. It's not worth for 17k. I am regretting after purchasing this phone.
very poor quality voice not clear camera very average .total waste of money
Poor performance, time lag,  at this price range this kind of performance unexpected . Totally waste of money.
I like only his company name apart from them i do not like any function of this phone.I am requesting you all please do not buy this mobile.
This product not good , over heating and hangs after phone call, very worst customer care executive improper response ,
I am a big fan of Samsung products.This model literally made me hater.  Didn't expect that Mobile is useless. Low performance. Advice to blocking M33 mobile from Samsung .Then only Samsung retained top 3 place in Market.
I am facing heating issues with this phone even during normal usages.No game or no heavy usages.Have already complaint Amazon for same, even technician doesn't come to check while it's already been escalated in Amazon customer care.
I bought this phone after using F22. Only to get added features. But this phone is not serving basic purpose. Netflix, Sony Liv and even Instagram videos are either getting stuck or showing error. Also, the phone is overall slow.
Camera is not responding not fully satisfied waste of money don't buy i have already complain it when buy but no technician is visit no response from Amazon and samsung also
Dislike the product, very poor performance. Camara clarity is not good.
The battery support lasts not more than 6hrs
The charging cable received has c pin both the side not sure where we get such adapter, also this phone over heats burns while keeping with you any where please do not buy this am returning this product, this phone heats up very badly please avoid buying Samsung phones
Waste of money please don't buy this mobile trust me..
Not good performance
Very bad touch,also start hanging.Very bad experience.
Power key not working
Samsung is a Good brand image. I have never expect this from brand.1. Poor Battery Backup2. Battery drained very fast.3. Hanging Problem.4. Face Recognition not working properly.
The camera quality is very poor front camera feels like it's a VGA camera the battery is draining so fast.  In all my life this is the first time I feel like using the worst product from Samsung.
Dislike
Just go with the product price dont see specification...you will only get what u paid off...19 k phone are purchased buy 100 buyers and 50k phone are purchased buy 5 buyers..@samsung just think how you are loosing precius customer by fooling them in terms of performance.
The phone has a perpetual connectivity problem. Data speed is always very slow and this problem is  not from the network providers side, its the problem with the phone.
Camera quality is worst than a 10k mobile phone camera.
Battery  camera is bad
Bhai bhul kar bhu mat lena set mai  falt ha fir bhu amazon vale time kharab kar rahe ha soo please don't buy this product and not satisfactory service in amazon
Samsung is playing smart with not providing customers with a charging brick on the name of saving environment from e waste.they should have provided normal usb C cable atleast so that existing charging adapter could  be used.
Don't go buy looking at better configuration, the phone is too slow on first day itself. I assume it will be slow as snails in few days. You get better mobile in this prize range.
Very bad display experience. Even HD videos are looking dull on screen. Please go for super amoled display always while purchasing a new phone.Good for normal usage.
Mony west product after two week my mobile outometic ded.Call is coming bu display off and not working.I think in this mobil display problem.Where i resolve my problem.
I bought first Samsung phone ever (M33) ans it sucksAfter an update every time I make video or click pic ..it automatically gets deleted and shows unsupported format. SeriouslyClicked from same phone still unsupported format
C-type USB at both end wire provided. If they are making changes from standard wiring they should either provide charger or clearly specified in reviews and product marketing material. Not even specified in fine prints. Disappointed.
Worst phone.. Totally damaged in 1st rain.. Just got wet in drizzle.. Totally dead
Not good
Mobile ke Sather charger nahi aya
Damage phone given don't buy guys and no mobile charger, waste of money
Very bulky motu wala, audio output quality not satisfied. Finger print sense is good. Regular updates from samsung.
after 10 days phone completely stop working. Useless phone. I want my money back.
Charging  adapter not provided.
Phone has 6000 mah battery, but it last only few hours, its draining so fast.
I hav purchased 6gb ram mobile but still facing hanging problem
Torch is not working
Poor battery backup.The fingerprint sensor is slow.
When I was using mobile for just 30 minutes then its becoming like a water heater
This is the worst phone I hv ever bought!! Functionality is very very slow!! Touch and display not working at all !! Disappointed and disheartening!! Extremely a bad one!! I want nobody to buy this.
1. LCD Display is useless, hardly visible outdoors2. Cheap, useless camera3. Phone should be max ₹5000/ only4. Got fooled, bought & regretting
All working fine
Product is good but no charger with this cell phone
Cheating  and cheep samsung mobile Battery  backup  is look like that  other mobile equal  1800mah battery lifeMobile video hanging call also hanging
The screen is completely malfunctioning. Inspection done. Awaiting replacement.
Overall phone is ok, except front camera which is of 8MP
I want to replace it .because of battery is draining fastly so please replace please 🙏please 🙏 replace it 0 to 100 percentage it coming only 2.40 hours 40 minutes so please replace it
Battery problem and overheating issue. Amazon collected all the needed details on over-radiating problem from the product delivered and then went unreachable eternally.
Keep another 2k handy to make the phone work as the cable is worthless without a 25w adapter..effective price 20k in which you can get much better phone..
Ghatiya ek dam 18000 mobile + 1200 ka charger liya per mobile always hang mostly time not useful product waste of money is acha toh MI ka 12 -14000 ka mobile Achcha hai
Adapter not provided.,,quality of camera not good..blur in clicked pics..it doesn't have power cool technology heated up while using ...lagging in showing caller id while get calls ..some apps performing well ..hangs sometime..
Low quality
So much heat and hanging problem heavy in weight
Good phone in low budget if you want Brands.Pro's:-Battery backup is good. With modarate activity it last for 2 days.-Touch is smooth-look and back panel colors are awesome.-good performanceCon's:-From the Samsung we expect better camera. It is not much good. Specially night vision is too bad.-display is average.
One of the very worst model I have ever seen. Pls don't go for this model
As I told before, the product exactly as described. What more to expect? I am using the product for personal use.
The mobile is not working after returning period has gone.
When new phone started,software to be update seenWhy this happened  in new phone ?This is not fare in this new phone
Phone temperature some time very high in normal use.Phone operating speed is not according to configuration .
Speaker problem , phone hang and no adapter
Good performance overall, fingerprint reader, battery level, camera quality ok ok but good performance overall completing money worth worth it
Charger not provided.....only data cable where to charge
Waste phone

Not Worth
Bahut hang krta hai... Network v aata hai aur jata hai...Bahut ghatiya mobile hai Samsung ka..

Totally bakwas hai hang krta hai
Fingerprint sensor not  working properly. There is line on the right side of screen after 2 week
Not upto my expectations , camera is not good at all. No Charging adaptor and headset with this model. Samsung fooling it's customers with flagship sale with low quality mobilephone.

i have not used this mobile,even i don't have any samsung mobile. m here just to check how Amazon allow me to write review without buy product.
Not at all worth it. The phone gets hot every now and then after using a month only. And the voice is also not audible.
Hanging issues, even if RAM is 6GB. Battery life is utter pathetic. Post full charge, You can use only for 5hrs. Waste of money.
Best budget phone in this range. Excellent performance. I find finger sensor is not so good else everything is fine.
very bad product
Worst experience with this phone, not capatible with applications I always have to re start the phone for using 3rd party application. Not recommended. Guys don't buy this phone

Hanging problem while copying text and during  internet usage , charger not included, finger print worst experience,
Phone heat very quickly. Showed alarm, and shut down all apps. The battery is not given a long backup.Not supporting 5G
Fingerprint don't work properly
Excellent battery life.Camera is good.Operational speed is high.Worth buying this product.Go for this product.Undoubtedly is good
1. Very slow and sluggish even for normal call, sms and web usage.Nearly unusable.2. Poor camera quality.
Bahut hi ghatiya company h Samsung Kashi bhul k bhi mat Lena bahut hang ho rha h processing had se jyada slow h.
Phone not used because they not provided mobile charger. Data cable given with both end C type not able charge with laptop our other charging adapters. I am very disappointed

HORRIBLE
This is phone is worst i seen ever.. it's hang a lot camera is not good also and worst it doesn't come with charger adopter.
No charger provided along.... Day by day increase in price with less quality and quantity of whatever we buy...can't just imagine buying a phone without charger.
Samsung's name and work both drowned out this product, as well as half the incomplete information given about this product.. Maybe Amazon should not be untouched by it.
Worst experience display gone in just one month.
Give me charger charger has not in the box why or contact me did not give I returned the mobile
Phone without charging adaptor. Just to show competitive price they lauched without charger. Its cheting with consumer. Even it was not noticed OR highlighted while purchasing .

We have to buy 25watts charger ans it cost Rs1700  so the total cost of Mobile is increased .cheated the consumers by not providing the charger
Charger not in the box have to purchase separately. Camera quality not upto mark. Even fingerprint sensor not good.
No charger included, price of charger is high ,ram speed average, battery draining too speed,  not expected with Samsung,  don't ever go for this
Battery time very waste.....
Samsung needs to include charger in box.
If performance is poor, which is its main function, then camera, battery, etc is of no use.
Worst mobile don't by this mobile is very slow and speaker is not working
ph having hanging issue.
Not a user friendly. Also so big in thick size. Planning to replace .
Already 2 month gone but can't matching charging cable and adopter with this phone

Kachda phone.dont buy
mobile is getting heated up while charging with recommended charger of 25W original Samsung travel adopter.
As this phone contains 6000mah battery, the backup of the device could be two days minimum.though backup depends on usages and varies person to person but as per my usages my previous phone was with 4000 mah battery and i was getting 1.5days backup easily.With this phone (m33.6gb) i am getting hardly 1 days backup.  But my expectation was minimum 2 days from this device.. not happy with backup. Rest is ok

Quality very good. Battery very good. Overall performance very very good. Value for money. Very much satisfied with the product
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY C TO C CABLE IS OFFERED WITHOUT ADAPTOR..COULDN'T FIND ADAPTOR IN MARKET TOO. Disappointed on this aspect.
World's best watch ever and it's features are so amazing guys just go and buy this product you will satisfy
Not worth to buy....
had high expectations for this phone. the phone works smoothly but it has major heating problem just on the first hour of its usage. can use it for ironing clothes. Waste of money.
One of the worst phone i ever bought very slow restart it takes too much time to open apps even there's is no background activity, always get hang i would rather prefer some other company smartphone at this price samsung is now very disappointing only top 60k+ phones are good below that just rubbish
Honest review after 20 days of useNote:- I have purchased this phone from other platform.Positive points:-Battery backup is excellentBack and front camers are excellent in daylight but performance is average in low lightPhone doesnt come with Amoled display but still quality is excellentProcessor Performance is excellent so farNegative points:-Travel adaptor is not included so we have spend around 1200 Rs. For a new adaptor, adaptor must be available at this price point.Phone is little bit heavy.Overall if you are looking for a quality phone then go for this.
Travel adapter is not included. Why i applying for exchange but system is not accepted even after verified IEMI. Over all not good.
Very good phone at great price. Everyone around can purchase it. I am totally satisfied with the performance as well.
The data cable only given but charger adapter not given through box. Then the question is how to charger our mobile without adapter.
heating problem within 30 minutes of using ,
Battery draining too fast.
Camera quality is not good.Mobile hang issues.Camera quality is not good. Don't buy this phone. Not goes foe Samsung brand
It’s not worthy of 17k
After using I can give 7 number all over  in 10 it's okay 👶  ☺ okay a lot more like
I buyed this phone on 31-12-2022 after 10 days  of using it is going directly to silent mode even after changing it to ringing mode after some time again going to silentode automatically... Any having same problem.... and rectification pl update thank you
main thing is mother board issue. after 12th month or 14th month suddenly not worked. this is product issue. if yo have any doubts please check it in google so many people complaint same thing. my mobile spoiled after 14th month. Samsung customer care not supporting also. so go other brand don't waste your time and money also.
This is so expensive when it's just LCD model! Samsung galaxy m21 is cheaper even with amoled. I'll stick with my m21.
don't buy facing a lot of heating issues the moment it gets delivered I regret choosing this you cant even play for a minute if you buy
Samsung M33 is very good value  for mony, good product  , no problem to purchase , battarty backup & camera quality good
Yesterday I got this mobileIt looks like refurbished oneIt should be out of the box Android version 12But I got Android version 13I also downlaoded PhoneInfo app and checked it is showing refurbishedHow to replace it?
Best in that price and it's 5g phone with 8gb ram wow 17000 rs best budget phone of samsung brand
I am usinh with dual sim, the sim network goes abruptly while you are on the call. You will have to restart the phone to get the network back.If any collegue sends a google meet link to join, it shows the app is not available in the phone but if I open the link on browser it takes me to the app again a pathetic experience who types the code?Hangs very often - resolution restartBattery life pathetic on a full charge with normal calls - 1 to 2 hours the battery drains to 10%Samsung going cheap in quality but price tag is not. Not expected
. Fingerprint sensor location is bad . Camera quality is dull and front cam is hell . For the price range it's not the phone we want . The speaker sounds blasted or malfunctioned .
Phone with great features and an excellent camera.Writing this after using the phone for one week.Pros:CameraFast and smooth uiBattery lifeScreen with Vibrant colours and refresh rateCons:Need to buy charger separatelyA good purchase
on other sale platforms this mobile available on ₹16,876 low price, so compare the prices before buying, not providing the travel adapter is a bad thing. Always says use company adapter and not providing adapter is just like selling the car without the steering.
Durable as well as usable phone overall, heavier in weight than most phones, excellent colour choices would recommend buying on sale for students in 11th or 12th
I like  it ,but improve the camera and longer battery life , but it ithis is very good phone i like
The camera quality at night mode is bad. In daylight picture it is very good. And samsung should give amoled for their phones under 20k because they are known phone their displays, one ui and cameras and all. So they should have given amoled display.
Putting this Review after using it for 2 week:Pros:It looks good in hand.Camera is somewhat good but not in indoors.Cons:Battery life isn't good.Phone hangs alotFingerprint scanner stopped working.Overall it was not a wise idea to purchase this phone. It seemed like they sent me some third grade Chinese phone without quality check. I am now fully convinced that samsung is wrost when buying low budget phone.
Poor service of Amazon. No return policy is available for this productHence, I would suggest not to buy.It's totally a wastage of money. Kindly beware and read all the reviews carefully and then purchase this product.Totally unsatisfied by the policies and services of Amazon and will not preferring buying anything from it.
Recommended.excellent battery life.good camera .Excellent processor, finger ,sensor.Airtel 5g is working well.getting security updates regularly. No hang.No lag.Only con is need to buy a Charger.
All Good, weighs more.. it feels huge... but it is fast efficient & not regretting experience for the Amoled miss... Battery backup awesome.. Camera nice overall .. Brand Samsung ... Quality...not heats ... steady ... lovely purchase for 15k + 1.2 k for adapter ... but fast charging 25 watt is awesome ....
I liked the One Ui, samsung has taken care about the little details like 4G+ carrier aggregation, voice focus, auto switch for internet, etc. I do multi tasking which is taken care by M33 pretty well. Although the Screen size is bit too large for one hand operation. This phone is perfect for mixed users in budget.
Bakwas phone its very difficult and heavy also material is bad tis weight soo havy and its using in work slow process is slow aslo
The phone and features are good. I like the screen quality and processing speed. Although fingerprint scanner not always works. Camera could be better as well.Overall good battery life, good processing heavy in weight.
I'd say the phone is, not too good not too bad, just normal for its price, everything is upto date, infact the 6000mah battery is plus point, only down point is the processor i guess, i sometimes see lags in games but other than that everything is good, camera, smoothness, ui.
Charger is not provided and data cable is c type from both side which can not be used in old charger.You are compelled to buy either data cable or charger.It is very bad and cheating to the customer.
Yes, I am using this product already since May, 2022. No doubt, it is a unique and awesome product. It's fingerprint reader, battery life and camera quality are awesome. Therefore, I request you to buy this product no hesitation.
Smuth  very good  full vallu product m33 5 g fast no problem  very nice  3day  feedback sound  quality  best  youtube picture  quality
I bought 8gb model from samsung online store .Product is good each point of view. But Amazon sell this product 1000 costly from samsung online store after card discount  in Great Indian festival sale.
I bought 8gb ram mobile from Samsung website itself.Bought few days back and this phone is really good with lots of features.Battery is 6000 mah so offcourse it gives good backupScreen is lcd, video quality is good (for this budget samsung can put max lcd screen)but not best as it is not Amoled(to get Amoled you need to invest more)Speaker is okCameras are ok okFeatures Edge to access apps, Knox and many are there which are really good for this budget120hz I didn't find any difference when compared with 60hz flagship mobiles(need to do more R&D on this)Fingerprint sensor is superb fast, I have Samsung Note 8 and its Fingerprint sensor is lagging with this phone5g need to check after few monthsOverall a stable Samsung Galaxy M33 phoneNote: In Samsung website 25w charger will get for extra Rs 300 with this phone
Ok, we can buy this product. It is good for usage. No problem. Finger print scanner is not okay. Ok
Compared to other mobile phones, Overall Samsung is the best, try to buy this because it is trustworthy and the price is also reasonable.
There is only charger cable no adapter .Heats too quickly .Camera quality is not that good . .
I like this product Very much. Because Battery longibility is very good. Processor is very fast. Camera is also high quality. Overall, it is a unique and awesome product in India
In this price range, a nice 5G phone with good display & solid batter backup. Does not heat or gets hang..
The camera quality is good for the price but the display is very decent and the processor is also decent. If you are a normal user then the processor is more than enough for you!🙂
Phone all over good but one worst problem.  I am using Jio Sim in my old mobile is perfect  but same place it is insert in Samsung m33 5g not getting worstsignal with connecting problem soo much lagging And i had tried sooo many places i got same problem,  worst experience with Samsung
Samsung is world class company but phone heating is permanent problem when high temperature 🌡️ phone deeply are too hot also phone back hot 🔥 All things are great
No charger.Charger cost is almost INR 3000.Total cost = INR 21000 (18000 + 3000) [6 GB]INR 24000 (21000 + 3000) [8 GB]
Super more than enough on such costGood battery life and too reliable and ergonomic stylish at minimum price so
Not Bad to use, generally Samsung is good product, user friendly, Durable and service free. I am using only Samsung mobile
Very gud delivery and mobile in budget.very gud sevices,looking so gud,styles mobile,awesume awesume awesume awesume awesum,gud gud gud gud gud
Nice,Beautiful, light weight, Advance features Unbelievable discount price provided by Amazon.in safe packing with promised schedule delivery,but at least Traveler charger should be included rest no word for Samsung product,it's third consecutive model on enhanced versions 😀 👍
Performance of this product is getting slow after getting old camera is good and processor also Better and for gameing we will get some what slow
My review is for Galaxy M31..  in 15 month my phone one day suddenly keep restarting until battery drained to zero.  service center says mother board need to be replaced and it will take near 9k(the phone cost was 18k) . later came to know this issue is there for long time and large number of customers faced it. Samsung even don't want to correct it.  service center receptionist in Bangalore brigade road even doesn't know how to speak in English, her response was like she holds a good position in a government concern.very disappointed Samsung .. didnt expect this from such a reputed brand.
Have 6000 mah battery that can use for long time, Have more optimising features that helps to improve performance and use, Have a LCD Display that works better . Image quality and camera performance are fine, have image size reducing heic format in camera options. .
I am writing this review after 1 month of use.Pros:1. Looks wise it great. Back is looks like glass but it's pastic.2.  Fingerprint is 10 on 10.3. For me camera quality is good. I like the erasing feature in camera.. its so good.. Cons:1. It keypad, hang sometimes it not minimise after typing you have to turn off screen for minimise  it. Back button stuck sometimes.I thing there are some  bugs in soft ware which might be resolved in coming  updates.2. Battery back up is so poor.. it give just  8 to 9 onscreen time at low brightness. Which might reduce if you increase the brightness..I am a medium range user of phone and for me battery back backup is important.
I feel like it has some network issues, I don't know exactly the issue is of phone or the sim, that's the small problem I am facing.
Nice nice very good to use to do anything nice to have camera yes purchase of this phone do do
Too much heating not burning🔥after 15 min use..Camera Quality not upto mark as per mentionedPhone comes 8+128GB mode but when you open that phone out of 128 GB storage phone takes 30GB and out of 8Gb ram phone takes 2.5GB for their internal process. Even Ram plus working as per description... Phone getting hang if you continually use 2-3 hours watching movies/Web series..Phone heated and hang too much, so you can't play games for long time.Phone will be work if you have only basic use like calling, SMS and Social media chats
Adapter should be provided  and pdf file  suppoertOtherwise  all are goodCam and battery  are OKAll over good
Wifi speed is very poor, frequently gets disconnected. No use.No proximity sensor. Virtual proximity sensor doesn't not work as expected and creates more trouble during call.50MP camera is not upto the mark; no zoom, poor lowlight photosVery bulky and uncomfortable to use
It's really good phone. Samsung is really good and I always buy it. One of best purchase I've made. Thanks to Amazon
Very nice product in budget All of u should take this mobile for low budget nice quality  thankuFor this product
back cover is brittle. got a crack
Everyone please note that charging adapter does not come with this phone we need to buy it separately ! Otherwise phone is excellent 👌
When it place In pocket zzzz coming it is disturbing me, Auto metically lock open, apps opened callls also going
We have all the best features like 5G, Rear Camera, RAM, ROM & Resolution. The best product in this budget. Only thing need to improve is the front camera pixel.
Fingerprint not much better,battery is good and camera images is not good as per m53 mobile model battery life is ex-odinary
Good product 👌 superb productSamsung always good product  .. .. . . . . . . . . .
This product is good but everything is not in the pack.camera is very good and fingerprint reader is very good.
Overall good but front camera  is bad battery life  good and gives long backup color  also new color model looks good
I liked it's battery camera finger print needs to be improve  video and connection features has to be improved  it is not pairing with smartphone properly
There is nothing good about this phone it's just piece of trash which will cost you 10-12k. I will not recommended you to buy this kachraa
Camera quality not for good it's just ok but some camera feature is really good..battery was not so much longer at all....and ofcourse..no charger no earlead.
Phone battery with 6000 mh is too good and it comes minimum for 2 days and complete charge takes 1 hour
Battery good. No heating issues. Os is really good. Best phone in 20000 range. Features like nfc 5g bands are imp
Not user friendly if you are a redmi user. If Wifi signal lost it will not select another wifi. Restrating takes time. Features are more but as I was Redmi user, feeling not happy with m33.Camera and battery backup good.If we enter pin it will not open you have to press ok button also.
I moved from poco F1 to this phone and this phone sucks in every aspect. Pls don't buy all you will get is Samsung branding over a very pity package.Looking to sell it in just 6 months of usage.
ok for average use, not for high end user, good 5g performance not good night camera output  but good in sufficient light
My wife brought the phone for me. Just a month ago. My experience about this phone is bad..this phone is lagging so much.and at price with no gadget is much expensive..
Why not giving charger.. extra packing extra box extra poly covering  is not threat to environment. Moreover extra money already taking so much money and higher price battery is downgraded.
Overprice but no charger in box need to buy separately charger 1500rs and TFT display,  redmi brand provides amoled display under 15k budget why can't samsung 😑
Don't buy this product not worthy for 16k.
Phone without charger? soon you guys also loose market like others. Many times small things also matters in countey like India.
Size is too big, too heavy, camera quality is not well at all, os responds too slow. Not worth to buy at all.
Worst phoneAlways shows Storage is full I don't know why?Other storage is using 100GB I don't why that us using that muchWorst worst worst phone
Pros1. 120hz adaptive display.2. Huge battery with good battery life3. Android 12, OneUI 4.1 with may security patch makes phone upto date when compared to new launches with Android 11.4. 2 Years of OS updates and 4 years of security updates, keeps as covered from software end.5. OneUI experience is superb, Gallery app has additional features compared to A series6. Responsive fingerprint sensorCons1. Camera unit under performs in night and very average in daylight. Color reproduction is poor.2. Video quality is limited to 1080p in YouTube3. Display is again average, a sAmoled with even 90Hz would have made a it great phone.Tip: I bought it from Samsung App, where Samsung is giving away 25W charger free.
This is a amazing phone. Good battery with camera quality and Sound is like dolby.So must buy this phone.
Adopter nahi hai or baki sb sahi hai..camera and ram space sb sahi hai weight bhi sahi hai battery sahi hai
After 1 year of use, I can recommend this phone. Long battery backup, fast, good clarity screen, nice camera and good build quality
Most M series are facing mother board complaint after one year. My phone also don't go for samsung . Waste and cheating
Paise kharab na kare ismobile ko lakar fingerprint kaam karna band kardeta h speak mai kabhi awaj ati h to kabhi ni Amazon ne mari koi help nahi kari na to replace hora hai or na return complete kari to isko reschedule karte jare hai koi help ki hai
Good budgeted mobile. Battery life is too good. Using this mobile from 1onth and find no issues as of now...
I m happy to purchase this product from Amazon, i also suggest to other that but maximum products from Amazon
samsungs foooishness is surprizing when it comes to providing snapdragon +865 chip high quality zeiss or other camera , and dolby atmos dual harmon kardon speakers. Those who prefer samsung , for us its a diagusting experience. New companies coming to this area are provinding this facility than why not samsung can fill  this segment which comes under S22 series and big buyers are available
Simply not worth it for the price.You don't get a 25W charger (or any charger for that matter), the display is LCD and not AMOLED, mid range Exynos chipsets age like milk and apart from battery, all other specifications are mid for the price range.
Why do we have to buy a travel adapter separately? Why is it not sold with the mobile ? This is not reasonable for Samsung customers.
Please don't buy Samsung M series phones.M series having manufacturing defects. These having restart issues after 1 year then we have replace motherboard and it costs more than 7k..So please don't buy M series phones.
Samsung has delivered another amazing 5G phone which is consumer friendly. Battery almost lasts for  20 hrs with normal usage. Good pictures and videos on 50 MP camera. We can also use this phone for office emails as it comes with Knox security which is a major advantage. Best phones for produce reels and YT shorts videos.
Pros:Battery back up is good. Camera quality is good(attached pics shot from plane withoutany filters and photo edits). Speaker phone is good. Screen sensitivity is too high, which is good.Cons:Phone is bit bulky. Face unlock takes long time to open. Screen transitions are not smooth. There is no necessity of using 90Hz refresh rate!!. The phone lags while you scroll up or down the screen. The lesson I have learnt is, don't buy any mobile looking at the RAM. Even if you buy a phone with 12 GB RAM and the processor is exynos or something, it's sheer waste of money. I suggest you buy any mobile which has Snapdragon processor.  By all means, it is good.
The fingerprint reader, battery and camera is top notch and the processor is also good. Supports 5G and is a good phone to start with.
....battery is good and camera too At a good price must buy.Samsung galaxy m33 5G...........................
Best Mid Ranger Phone. All Rounder. i love it. Super Quality Phone from the Most Reputed Brand of this World
This phone the M33 5G does seem to be really worth for it's price.Pros :All though it's not stereo speakers but the speaker quality is really good, I don't why no one's talking about that.120Hz display is smooth6000mAh - that's the selling point manThe processor is capable for the priceCons :It's a TFT display so the black appear slightly gray (all though you'd mostly not notice it)Don't think you get a quad camera system since you have one 50MP sensor and the remaining are 5MP, 2MP,2MP you probably will never use thoseOverall : If you want a good and bloatware free android experience for roughly 20,000 rupees this phone's worth it
Front camera & touch is pathetic ..trust me don't buy if u want selfies...back camera  , battery & performance is good
Battery life very good..It would have costed Rs 2500 less as Samsung gives charger and protection at reasonable rates. For 17999/ I would have got better deal. Amazon does not provide charger. If charger is given  lakhs of customers can use it immediately. I had to wait for 2 days to use phone as no other charger fits. Sadly a very low standard worn-out rough sim tray supplied.  Buy this phone from samsung website only for satisfaction.
Like the design very much, unexpected colour apperance and meterial body flawlessly designed thanks Samsung team and Amazon i am happy.
Dont buy. only camera is ok rest waste of money. Battery is not good, heavy weight. Not happy with this phone.
Excellent Screen touch and feel ,the screen space is complete no cutting corners it would take a couple of days to get used to holding if you were using different phone earlierit's amazingly light weight was initially thinking of buying a cover but didn't wanna ruin the beauty of the phone Suprisingly steady and didn't break when I dropped it accidentallyBatter is super fast and last for a long time
This handset comes with the Exynos 1280 processor which is the worst ever processor in Samsung . Never buy this phone this processor can't even handle basic tasks and it's even hangs in operating YouTube
29 October 2022 book samsung m33 mobile. 30 October ko lekar bhi aaya par verification miss match bolkar . Parcel return lekar gaya our item rejected dal diya .
The phone is having slow speed while using browser with 200mbps wifi internet connection. 8 gb RAM is not showing its presence.
I am not able to talk on the phone properly and this phone is not catching signals while all my other phones and previous phones were able to catch signals properly.
Within 3 months of non frequent use, strated seeing slowness in the performance, camera is not functioning. Once you upon Camera App it states Warning : Camera failed. Not a reliable purchase, caution
Review after 1 week of usage. New phone battery getting heated up, Battery charging drowning soon. Apps are not working.
Satisfactory performance at this price point. The phone works well. Display is good. Battwry backup is sufficient. It has not snagged or lagged so far. Happy with it.
Below avg battery life. Screen is ok. Brightness changes very slowly and sometimes for no reason. Heavy.Android 12 is plus point and higher refresh rate for screen also.Overall, should try another device.
I had 4 phones in home all Samsung M31, 3 have already hanged permanently and not turning on now  within 18 months of purchase . Seems that's a common problem with Samsung . I bought it on the name of made in india. But they are selling sub standard products.  Samsung don't even try to better it and launching new phones with same processors. If you want to lose money on this within two years, go for it
Charger should be provided along with the mobile. Samsung behavior is very cheep by forcing customer to buy Charger separately with too much expensive
Due to this anti-china thing, I replaced most of my family's mobiles from Mi & Motorola to Samsung. But now the chips have started to fail exactly post 1 year, Samsung will not take ownership of single product.I own currently:1. M31: Green dot in screen which keeps ever expanding 6000 INR plus 1.2 Years2. M31s: Stuck on Logo on restarted cost of repair 9000 INR Plus 1.6 Years3. M33: Keeps overheating and restarting, even if in warranty the maximum times you get a free service is 2 times a year. 0.1 Years old4. A72: Charging issue's! Repair cost 4000 INRPlease don't go for Samsung if you wish for peace of mind ! Though the high end Samsung phones are good.
It is a good phone and has a good battery life, and a good camera just the processing speed could have been better
Battery backup is excellent. The display quality is good. It has a powerful GPS receiver that gets a fix in seconds. The camera takes good pictures even in low light situations. It is a little heavier and bigger than other phones and should be carried in a holster.
Battery draining too fast very very worst mobile . please improve the battery backupFirst' time I have purchased this worst mobile in samsung electronics
Camera quality is like 2mp very bad camera quality very very bad quality if u buy 5000 phone that's camera quality is far better from m33 I strongly recommend don't buy this phone
samsung phn is not long lasting.. 1 saal m mere phn m itni dikkat aain 26 hzaar ka phn bss ek saal chla apne aap sort ho gya display chli gyi...care wale seedha kehte hn motherboard pdega 12 hzar rupae lgenge...bkwas phones aate hn ab samsung k
Software not working properly.Voice typing problem.Not exchange amazon or flipkart Sid this Samsung galaxy m33 product.Better not 6000 only 3500 or 45000Very Very bad 👎
I want with charger ,  no charger no 5 star , phone is good but where is charger. . ?
Company should have provided the charging adapter with phone. It's same like company is selling Car but without Tank....  Samsung customer
I am using this product since May, 2022. Fingerprint reader and batteey life are amazing. Camera quality is much more better. It's processor is so good. The colours of this product are very attractive. Finally, it is a unique product no doubt.Therefore, I request you to buy this product only.
Samsung is going to cheat the customers as they are not provide adapter. please ignore Samsung phones then only will come on track.
Very bad product , how I will return this product , noise is not clear on calling , very bad
Amazing phone such a good camera and having a good battery backup it lasts for more than 15-16 hours .And it is the best phone compared to other brands. Good phone in best price.Screen is also good with TFT display .charging is also fast. Good sound also .
Airtel has launched 5G network in India and i tried to use 5G, Airtel says "your handset does not support 5G", Please see the attached screenshot
I bought this phone for my friend . He is not only happy but was so excited seeing this phone. My friend stays in day boarding. He was not having smartphone before this. This is his first smartphone. Thank you Samsung for making it good.
Excellent Phone.. Almost using now for more that 20 days. Don't what people write in reviews that thereis no charger and headsets along in box? When it clearly says this is not included?. Battery life is great. Phone gets charge fast. Camera is awesome.  Perfect phone.. definitely go for it.
Extra 1500 add for purchase for charger.What is this?Samsung u have no capacity to afford a travel adopter ...shame on you..
Within 10days Battery dead. Very Worst  Don't go for samsung with low budget phone only 7days return policy so disappointed
I have purchased the Samsung M33 and with in 2 months its display got out of order and hang. 20 days have lapsed but neither service center or Samsung company bothered to solve it.My mobile was hannged on 05.08.2022 and today is 27.08.2022 but still i am waiting for resolution. I will never recommend to buy Samsung product due its poor quality of product and after sales service as well as  no body is there in management to listen your complaint also.
This Phone battery is too good.Camera quality is OK but too good.Finger and Face unlock is super fast...
I like this mobile it is having  advanced features , great sound quality and very good appearance.. Thank you so much for Amazon handling the product carefully and timely delivery.. kudos for Samsung for the wow product..
Don't purchase Samsung worst product in brand new phone on display showing black spot, dnt trust samsung. I hate samsung
three carrier aggregation supported..good network reception...display looks excellent...bright and vibrant display...almost similar to amoled..vewing angles are also good...camera is average...sound is good....good perfomence..over all a good phone and value for money.....
Never ever buy Samsung Mobiles now. Gone are the days when samsung phones were price efficient and durable. Now they have started plundering customers by providing cheap materials and launching mobiles without charger. Samsung has started to assume itself Apple. Further once the warranty is over, even for minor repair issue, they charge hefty fees and ask to replace the entire part . Worst ever experience with samsung. A lesson must be taught to Samsung.
They make the Indian people fool by selling worst quality processor there phones are dead after 1 or 2 year ..don't trap in samsung
You get what you expect, best part about Samsung. It is not only budget phone but the features you see are way more than amazing.  Gifted this to my grand ma, Couldn't see someone more happy than this.
Because this handset is 5g and it's finger quality  is good but not covered the right way so,changes are must necessary and looking  and another thing is very good
Third class brand Samsung mobile. friends don't buy. Its My personal experience of Samsung galaxy f 62 is very bad.  I hope u understand. Namaste
Battery 🔋 life goodPhone nice workCamera  working 💪Worth pricesLooking  goodPacking  niceGaming superAlso good working
Amazing screen quality with 5g ,worth buying ,if you want to buy a latest 5g phone then go for it, attractive offers by amazon, thank u so much samsung for this innovation.
Mobile hanging too much. 6000 mah  Battery 100 % drain just in 10-12 hours in normal use. Samsung customer care and Krishna mobile service center very very bad response. Just in one month my mobile stop working after service center people change display and mother bord but not fitted correctly and my mobile's back panel still in open condition. Totally ghatiya mobile don't buy even in 5000. Exynos 1250 very very very bad processor don't waste your money. Very very ghatiya mobile
Dont biy this Model from Samsung. Two of my friends purchased this and ran into problems. One needs to change display and other has to change the motherboard. Better buy other models.Its a defective model from Samsung
I am happy got boat fast charger it works fantastic . Photo image's good  fast  charging battery life is good
worst one, overpriced for sure, and a big dislike for price hike even after 6 months after release. no charger, no amoled, processor isnt well optimised, a complete bad product.
Best samsung mid range mobile. Better Camera quality .battery back up best .most point to buy this phone is that you can use for 4-5 year for your study like mbbs .you can store data and use long time .
Samsung galaxy m33  is a Good phone. I like Samsung phone  only.camera quality is also good  finger print  reader good
Nice phone par abhi kuchh din or chalane ke bad pata chalega over lod par . Phone ka batter kaisa hai

Stylish phone with good battery life, appearance,  smooth fingerprint scanner, light weight, sleek design ♥️But camera is not upto mark with 4 camera.Still good choice
After few years phone battery also not given purchase separately 😁😁😁 then only given phone case only u can purchase mother board charger all accessories buy separately
Overall good product in this segment. Camera quality could be better. Mid range phone. Look wise very good.Nothing else.
Great handset, working smoothLong battery life Woking on both 2.4G and 5G WiFi, super fast mobile, no heating issue
Worth buying😃..Camera quality is also good.Slim design, amazing battery life.Happy and satisfied 😌Thank you amazon 😄
guyzz its an awesome handset go for it  totally apatite Samsung for bringing an such an amazing handset.both camera are perfect seems like using an apple device
Best one at this price, brought. till this time, no issues or any other problem.Whatever they had mentioned about features,  truly all are working well.It's a pure Indian taste..
Phone is like disaster working very slow one small scratch in display warranty will void getting issue from within 2 month processor is slow
I purchase with Price 14999, low quality camera, very slow performance, app loading to much, leggy  phone. DON'T BUYBATTERY PERFORMANCE IS GOOD
Charger nahi hai to kya matlabBody Diya but usme brain hi nahi.No usefull high configuration ka koi matlab nahi
Phone might be ok but removing adaptor from it's mid range phones in the name of saving nature and than selling it separately is really a cheap strategy. NOT EXPECTED FROM SUCH A REPUTED BRAND.Using TFT instead of LED in phones to cut the cost might be justified and even Samsung could use even their AMOLED screen too.But no adaptor is not at all aceptable..Samsung even needs to stop making phones to save the nature as plastic is also used in making phones.Samsung  pls mind we, the customers, are not fools.
Night camera mode is blurry could have worked on that. Battery life and charging in good, pro mode shutter speed is only 10s.
Was very excited while purchasing this phone but all my excitement and money was wasted, extremely poor quality of display. Was not able to view YouTube properly even at 480p. No adapter provided which cost me additional ₹1200.Guys please don't go for this it's fully waste of money at this price.
It's probably one of the best phones. Battery life is great and camera quality  is awesome. It functions smoothly and I just love it😍❤️
Mobile quality and  operate is good but in mobile not include the charger only adapter cable is givenSo near about 1k extra charge is spent for basic accessories.
Don't Buy, if Samsung not able give original charger alone with phone with this amount of money.  Boycott this type of products
Batry back up good camera is everageI'm using Samsung mobiles last 8 years without any problemI always goes for brand and quality
This is a very nice phone I came across this year. Meeting expectations. SlimLight weight phone. Handy. Display is clear very
Battery life , camera quality is excellent . three way security to unlock phone is superb and very easy to handle.
Everything is good in phone fingerprint reader,You could mention fingerprint reader, battery life or camera quality life or camera quality
My phone M series M31 and A21 both are stuck on logo in starting. Avoid Samsung Exynos chipset phones as their motherboard is not at all reliable and after one year Samsung will not help you in any way.The problem is globally known and please research it online. They are not using good hardware to compete the market.

Ghatiya, camera quality is worst. 50 mp my foot. Mera Nokia n70 2mp was better than this, worst camera worst processor, started hanging after just 9th day...looking if I can return this shirt...didn't found it's back cover in market. Yes, voice quality is very good, other than that, don't buy it, galti se bhi...I used Samsung galaxy 's advance several years a ago, was a gem...isliye Samsung liya fir se but...expected more than this #samsung
Use the credit Card offers combined with other offers, got it for 13k, it was a good deal. Overall performance is good.

I like unmatchable display camera battery sounds and performance so much.No one can beat it's in this price segment.
Very good..I am completely satisfied. It is very helpful. Looks elegant. Very good enhanced features. Picture quality is really amazing.
Given review after using this phone approx 4 month. Camera click speed is very poor. You can not use two applications in one time. When phone is ringing the screen is on. Taking too much time to show call notification.I suggest don't go with this phone please try other phone.
I like phone colourDislike is packing Accessories was come short....So.... please add Adopter also to this product ... ...
Really sad with Samsung this time. I bought this one year back and all things were working fine. One day when i plugged in for charging, it starts heat up and after 5 min working it's mother board got dead. Warranty time was also completed. Can't suggest for samsung phones
Samsung got all things right on paper like-- exynos 1280 has on paper performance greater than snapdragon 695.- samsung cameras way better than peers.- 8 gb ram- 6000 mah battery- samsung promise of 4 year android support.Now inspite of all these goodies the phone in real world turns out to be a big average. Reasons are mentioned below (after one month and all samsung updates installation)-- exynos 1280 turns out to be a problem here- phone heats on normal usage.- 120 hz display stutters in between.- 6000 mah battery drains a lot with basic use. Phone cannot run for more than 2 days with basic usage (no games and videos).- apps freezes in middle inspite of 8 gb ram and virtual ram..- camera quality average.- 120 hz lcd display- other brands are offering atleast 90 hz amoled display in this price range.Bottomline-- now samsung is good as it offers 4 year android support. Thats the usp here.- 6000 mah and exynos 1280 are good on paper but software implementation is not smooth here. I hope this will be resolved by samsung soon.- those who dont want to purchase new phone can go for brands like iqoo z6 pro or motorola phones in this price range..
I never expect amazon deliver behavior not acceptable, its because of samsung product I think so not sure.I don't think so samsung having good capabilities since I used two products and not found any single feature good compare to redmi. Amazon also send deliver with diffent guy not exact the deliver person.and he is rejected my product after calling right person over the phone.
Well I wanted to try Samsung for the first time but it turns out to be a disaster. It’s really pathetic  experience. The phone is bulky, big notches and it looks like a decade old phone. It was not available in any Samsung outlet and I couldn’t experience it and available online only. I trusted Samsung but all trust gone in vain.I bought this for basic office usage but this phone dosent even fit for that. Really worst camera, screen brightness is really below normal, face recognition does not work all time, finger print scanner is not at all sensitive.Ufff what’s else can I say. I just sold it for half price and got a good Real me budget phone.Thanks Samsung for giving me such a experience and if you keep making such products, you will regret in a very huge way in the future no matter how powerful are your flagship phones. For being a cult brand like Apple, you need to work on it. If you can’t make good budget phone, just stop doing it.
Battary low after 5 hrsScreen shot problemNot value for moneyWorst phone everNever never buyDispoinnted samsung
Technically this feedback is not for the exact model But based on earlier model , M31s. I felt to convey here so that new buyers have a perspective beforehand.M series phone have some fundamental issue with their design and construction. I faced phone going blank in about 17 months. Now one can argue that its beyond warranty. Still mother board kind of core going kaput in 17 months is bad. After my search on few forums, I realized that this issue is not isolated, there are quite a few of these. While I can not comment statistical % but it seemed quite. And odd part is many of these are just after is or little after warranty expiry. As a user thats actually worse because now you will need to spend almost half of cost for repairs, defying the so called value these mid tier phones were supposed to provide.I am sharing this on this product as this issue are known after using it for sometime and anybody who is looking for buying this should have perspective of 1- 2 years of usage.
I felt one of my wrong decision was to buy this phone. the phone is hanging within 2-3 days. No option to give Minus star otherwise I have given it to it.I am using M31 and it works superb, But M33 is real bad.
pls dont buy Samsung M series phone definitely your  phone will not work after 18 month bcoz all phones having issue in motherboard pls dnt buy pls visit samsung website complaint page before buying samsung phone. 90% of phones became dead due to motherboard problem
Phone has lots of glitches..my humble request is to please don't buy this product. It's waste of money for you... Processor is one of the worst ever... Much disappointed i never expect this from samsung...i purchased this 1 month before now I have no clue what I'm going to do with this phone... exchange value is also low in offline showroom...they are claiming this phone for only 10000... Please don't buy this product
Worst since password for any app does not save to clipboard, even 5000 rupee phone gives this feature...Speaker volume is very low during calls as compared to 500 rupee phone
ConsCharger not includedCamera is average at bestThing heats up even on mild use,you can mitigate this by putting in power saver mode but then the phone is laggingAmbient light sensing is trash takes too longProAverage all rounderSamsung pay, it's unbelievably comfortableScreen qualityThings is really well A/B tested, you will nit feel at first.but things are were they are supposed to be, ease of access etc
My old phone for exchanged is valued 1650 + 100(order pickup) given all conditions mentioned in the provided document are met - phone is in working condition, no scratches no physical damage on product. but once it is at the door step they say i have to pay 450 rs saying phone is heated up even the iPhone heats up when charged
1 saal se Jada bhi nahi chalega yeh.. I bought Samsung 31s 10 months before...or sala 1 saal bhi nahi hua motherboard khrb hogaya....worst brand.....in this price range you will find better....if you don't want to waste your money then please don't go with this brand
Dont buy this phone. M series getting faulty now a days. my M30s phone got a fault of processor. i repaired it 3 times even though same fault occurs. then i sold it and bought realmi phone.
Samsung is  to loot the customers.... They don't give any accesories with the phone. Even they will force you to buy charger from their website only the way they have designed ..DO NOT BUY AT ALL!!! GO FOR OPPO VIVO.
My phone has been working fine for the last one year. All of a sudden, it started restarting and sometimes hung on the Samsung logo screen.I tried to do a factory reset as well. However, no luck. it's a clear hardware issue. I had a lot of trust in Samsung. I hope they will take care of it by replacing it.
Samsung m31 has mother board issue in fact all Samsung m series phones have mother board problem I purchased 2 Samsung phones last year m31 and m51 both of them are having problems now and they are asking 7k for repair board problem
I purchased this one from Samsung shop app for ₹13,140incl.adapter(Referal and exchange discount).This is the best phone by samsung this year in midrange. The Cameras have exceeded my expectations proving that megapixel count actually doesnt matter if the ISP and processing is done the best way. No lags in UI just disable customisation services in the initial setup and delete/disable unwanted apps after setup for smoother experience.  Good Ram management and fast download and installation of apps.No problems in network connectivity. Has 12 5g bands which is an advantage.The battery life is also major USP of this phone but due to this the the weight has significantly increased to 215g and with case it just feels uncomfortable holding it.Software is the best android skin of today.The screen quality is also pretty good, never felt that I am using a  PLS TFT LCD panel although I am using good quality amoled pannels since 2019.Prior to this I have usedM30M30SM31 &M52.So this one is really a value for money. Not a gamer's phone though processor is capable of handling anything you throw on it(ofc not genshin impact) but casual gaming wont be an issue as there is almost no heating even due to exynos this time.There is a deal going on currently on samsung website about charger for 299rs only, so check that out.
Such a costly phone but without charger! Still can't believe that Samsung does so.Earlier they removed headphones, now charger slowly cable, manual etc would be removed.
Dont go for Samsung M,A and S22 as after one update it will stop working in boot screen and the motherboard will malfunction which will cost a high amount.If it is in warranty it may work.After using J7 for 7years i trusted in Samsung but lost faith in M series.
I bought this for my mum.The specs is not very intriguing but yes it has set a standard for itself.I know there are cons. but, really? Do question yourself why?Let me do it for you and I hope it helps.1. Bulky phone: yes it is bulky, i mean very Bulky, but if you open your eyes wide you will see it has 6000 mah battery with reverse charging. Dude its a emergency power bank for you other device. (Provided you have a 25W AFC charger, i will come to this later) battery backup is phenomenal.2. It has a little mediocre camera but screen is quite good for a LCD (i wish it was amoled). oh yes, camera, I WOULDN'T WANT TO BET ON ITS PERFORMANCE. It is so so, but does the work. MOM is happy, Then there is no question of any cringing.3. Charger not included but has both end type c cable included. I like that, i definitely like that Samsung. Be it the devices capability. But i know where Samsung is taking its RnD to. Type C to type A cable, i bet you cannot get AFC (ADAPTIVE FAST CHARGING). Lets forget fast charging, type c to type a cable will only restrict to usb 3.0 or 3.1 data transfer. Type C to Type C transfers? well. Its developing and its good. I have a Samsung S20 plus adapter with me which my mom uses it now with the white c to c cable. No issues. I request others also to switch to c to c cable charging and data transfer. Type A is going obsolete people.4. This freaking phone has NFC, It can do wonders with Samsung pay.... wow a 13k to 18k budget phone doing that, my mind is blown. For get about samsung pay, my mom doesn't use it. I got my mom a sony earphones. She flawlessly connects it via NFC, HOW COOL IS THAT.5. I got 6 gb version for my mom and put a 400 gb memory card that i had lying with me 😃. There is no limit now for my mom to click pics that she loves. I also have office 365 subscription, with 1 tb one drive, wink wink 😉6. My next plan is to get my mum is a smart watch, she started to notice the steps in the samsung health app now a days.7. 2 years os update and 4 years security update. Technically, a non tech savvy person like my mum doesn't need too many OS updates, but a 4 year security services update is a good deal.8. My s20 plus screen, out of no where screen showed green lines, and then within a day it turned the screen white and i had to pour a ransom to fix it. White screen means money, green line is free screen replacement.  Funny samsung policy 🤣. I hope it doesn't happen with m33 5g9. Yet to review 5G performance.10. One UI: I dont think i need to mention anything about this. God level UI in Android devices. And some unique functionality like edge panel etc and split screen or floating screen etc. I wish it had bixby routines.11. Yes i know it doesn't look good, especially the camera setup. Hope i can upgrade to better model later, but for now this is working out OK.I think I have mentioned enough 🥲 haha. Fact is that people have lot of high hopes and expectations for mid ranger phones, they dont read or see reviews before buying. I hope they realise and make better decisions for themselves be less a b u s i v e and make world a better place to live in.
Samsung M series have problem of restart. After 1 year of use this series phone have a problem of restarting..I have M-21 recently I have visited so many Samsung service center they are also saying that Samsung M series have a problem of restarting itself.
Ek no khatara phn, vajan jaada, price bi jaada, camera 3rd class , aur sabse bada surprise adaptor nahi hai uska alag karcha 1500 ka, koi mat lo ye phn
Do not purchase mobile from m series ...which you cost more repairing charges within 18 months & headache  to fix it
After using for 3 days I am writing the review.1. TFT- Feels way better than Amoled Displays of other brands. I use indoor at less than  20% brightness.2. SOUND- Decent. I am watch You Tube videos at 30% the max volume.3. Super Fast Processor- So far handled all app easily. Insta, Lightroom, VN, reels, shorts etc feels super smooth. I haven't played any games so can't comment on that.3. 50MP CAMERA- Surpiringly good in this segment. You won't regret buying a samsung for it's camera.4. Pro Mode- If you click photos than the Pro mode of this device would definitely make you happy. I took some long exposure shots and very much satisfied with the results.5. Night Mode- With the update it got better, using tripod improves the quality a lot. I use Long shutter speed in Pro Mode to take Night Photos.6. Selfie Camera- My previous phone had 13MP and it was okay, but the 8MP camera of M33 feels way better and produces much real like colour tones and details.7. Heating- Haven't faced any major heating issue. For more than 3hrs heavy use it gets slight warm but cools down within 1-2 mins.8. Charger- Yes you need to purchase seperately which is already written. Don't understand why are people complaing.
Call recording feature on dial pad and network speed moniter absent many more things are minus point of this device
Front camera is very poor. Even rear cameras are too slow to capture. Even  Ui is not user friendly. Really disappointed . Moreover no charger. Worst experience in any samsung product.
AFTER FEW MONTHS OR MAYBE 1 YEAR, THERE WILL BE AUTO RESTART AND MOTHERBOARD ISSUE.KINDLY DO NOT FALL INTO THIS SCAM BY SAMSUNG
My two M series phones became dead after its warranty is over and it's not repairable . Very pathetic situation.All Samsung service center know that inherent problem is there with mother board
Main problm is charger  not in the box this phone. 15000 renge prize plus of this phone but charger? How charge this phone. Bina charger wala phone ko aarti ootare kya? Don't buy this phone .
M aur A series ke sabhi mobel me problem aa rahi. 6 to 7 mounth me hi phone me problem aa jati h. Company ka koi support nhi h.  Mere ghar me M series ke 3 phone h aur teeno me IC me problem aai h...so plz koi M series ka phone na me.
Full lag issues, 64gb memory card also not supporting properly (hanging a lot).Screenshot capture procedure is worst.Can't disable network usage for selected apps.Camera is not at all matching near to its rivals.
Writing here after 4 days of usage. I am dissatisfied with this product with my below observations.1. Battery is draining toooooo fast. Observed that on average 1% for 1 -2 minute(either wifi or mobile network).2. Samsung /amazon promotes this as monster battery(6000 mah). Im sure this is not at all a monster. I feel this mobile battery will exhaust within 2 to 3 hrs if you are a very agressive user ( I didn't feel to touch /use much based on my 1st impressions).3. Screen auto brightness is also big flaw, as screen lighting doesn't adjust appropriately even if you are under full lighting also, it suddenly dims / increases screen brightness (im using adaptive brightness is ON) and you should adjust manually.4. Always feel like you are carrying a heavy weight item with you.5. Atleast charger should have included with the package at this price.(amazon is charging high price compare to samsung website price, better to buy directly from samsung).6. Fingerprint sensor response is very quickly, but by mistake if you forgot or put other finger on it,  keeps shouting  fingerprint  mismatch, not at all user friendly one.Final word, Not worth to buy, Don't go with so called reviewers and don't waste your money on this phone.  Big big unmonstered battery phone.Note: Searched for multiple brands in the same budget but lastly been forced to take this phone.
Not worthy Don't buy.Am giving grades to this PhoneCamera 3Processor 3.1Ram 3.5Samsung is to be improved.
people Don't Go with this faulty product, after 1 year it will start a hanging problem, if you go and ask the Samsung customer care they will tell one good reason - you have used different charger so mother board had a problem. -----------  Samusung mobiles had a hanging problem. Hard earned money was looted by these ---------------
Nothing good in this mobile ,  Amazon platform has no good products to sale, that is why it is going down
Fingerprint and battery is just fine....but camera is very bad...i think you should purchase some another model like redmi note 10s...and many more...but there is not a single product in 2022 which we can say worthy smartphone.
Sharing feedback after using this phone for 8 months.This phone is total waste of money.Battery backup, camera picture quality, touch screen and finally after May 2022 upgrade speed became worst..Really disappointed with Samsung
Charger to dena chahiye tha yrr kya karoge itne paise bacha kar samsung walo..... I loved samsung alot but ab to samsung ka phone lene ka man nahi karta.... Better I can prefer a Chinese brand kam se kam vo box me charger to de rahe hai...
No charger included in box. Not mentioned in product details. Very high customer inconvenience and did satisfaction.The recepient of this gift has to wait 10 days for the charge to arrive.Horrible.
Request to all, never buy any Samsung model. such pathetic quality and sales after services.  If you van then just for apple or buy another phone like redmi , oppo but dnt waste ur money in samsung phone
Dont by online go to shop and buy and see only price hear and same time hedphon chirger cabal ect missing
The wifi connectivity is really bad, that you will have to always reconnect to access internet and trust me it's baaaad. Even a 6k phone does a better job that this piece of crap.
M series phones are failing badly. Repair is costing Rs.7000. Not advisable and I have lost Rs.16500 for M31 phone
Samsung has been fooling its customers since its last few products. Now this new drama of not providing adpater. An unnecessary step to match up with iphone ( with zero quality product)
The strategy of Samsung is totally waste of not providing Adaptor to customers, the strategy will end up in bad reviews from customers :) ;) #samsung
Remove headphone, remove charger and one day will come they will sell everything separately. Crap phone... Better to stick with other brands. Samsung officially the second crappy brand after apple
For fifteendays use it's worst phone .charging issue occur this m series don't by this samsung go for other bands.i disappointed this mobile waste of money
Dont by this item without adapter , bina adapter ke kaha charge karenge , isse achcha to dusri compony ka kharidi karle .
No adapter received. They should at least provide the adapter in the box with mobile. Mobile is good but no punch hole display. Camera is ok
Dislike.. I am going to throw away this phone realme.. because of glance lock screen app.. Very annoying 😡.. Not suggests to buy this waste product
Camera is ok ok type, performance is too lagging .not worth for this price at all. As earlier samsung mobiles are always lagging so I wouldn't prefer anyone to buy Samsung again
Not worth as per price. Lowest quality at all not to buying it.Screen shot very difficultIn coming call not showing only ringining and ringing
Camera quality is very very poorFace detection not working properlyFinger print sensor malfunctioningEven 8GB of RAM processor works slow
Charger not provide so I il not buy in abroad include charger also why like this no need box ear phone also no have
Bakwas no re-sale value. Do not by sumsung m series smart mobile.  Company kud bhi nahi kharedne wali m c m c
No charger so not buying samsung product it's for our good so be happy for loosing customer don't copy apple be yourself.. We don't buy apple because of this like reasons
Presently with out charger,in future without battery, without data cable.purchase charger, earphone, battery ,data cable sepretly.Good very very good .👍👍👍👍
Vedio playing issues in this phone I am very sad to buy this mobile I have to restart mobile then play vedio
Call recording not working.  Sensor is not properly working. First look is not impressive. And charger is not provided. Touch is not that much good
Adapter not bundled, later Display wont be bundled and would be asked to purchase the display seperately,only motherboard in the box...ROFL
Please do not buy this product it has no charger, you have to pay ₹1500 extra for charger.Waste of money ....
This doesn't come with charger not good display not good battery the processer is worst get heated easily not have good build... What else do I buy it for
Beware of buying. No OTT platform like Amazon prime, Netflix, Disney Hotstar etc. works on this ! Waste of money
Third rate camera especially selfie camera. You will look jaundiced in whatspp chat. No adapter provided. Buy it separately for Rs 1300. Regret buying this phone
No charger don't buy guy's better buy other mobiles one plus realme or mi or Vivo or oppo or Moto.....
Everything is implemented in the form of functions of the product is not what I love you too much too much too much too much too much too
Buy it and buy a 16 17 hundred adapter separately!! More better options available, go for xiomi or one plus
Some pics has bar like color changed and the important part of images some places bars hidden the content area.
No charging adaptor and ear phone. Cable provided is c type both end so that user will buy samsung charger only
Selling phone without charger is very foolish idea. No one will buy it separately.Idea is very foolish by samsung
Pehle earphone dena band ki aur ab charger bhi nahi de rahe hai.. sidhe sidhe loot lo customers ko bkwas phone
No adapter along with handset. It need to be purchase separately. It seems to be not fair and huge disappointment
Don't buy Samsung's Mobile until they give charger by itself in the box.Selling worst  product day by day .
No charger in the box very mad move by samsung.. Don't buy mobile without charger avoid Samsung Samsung sucks making money
Bakwas qualityIt's not original productPlz replaceIt has so many issuesSo plz be clear my issue urgently
Hi Samsung.. please don't release phone without Adapter. This was your first attempt without Adapter but it failed.  Got  3.sth stars only.
Very bulky and not Slim,camera not up to the mark,Performance ok at this price,Adapter to purchase separately means +1500
Don't buy this phone. One of the worst phone in samsung brand. Touch screen  not working properly. Don't Don' buy.
I bought this phone for the 5G coverage which is scheduled to rollout later this year. I knew that the charger is not included and also that the display is not Amoled, so cannot find any fault there. The only Pro is the battery which last for a long time (2 days).Now the cons,1. The camera is terrible and the app does not allow the user to selection the resolution. With Open Camera, you cannot exceed 12 Megapixel. There is one option of 50 megapixel and 4:3, but the pics are terrible and take about 3 seconds to write to storage. The low light pics are worse than my 3 year old realme 3 pro. There is no difference in the quality of image between 12 and 50 megapixel. My guess is that the actual camera sensor is just 12 megapixel.2. The specification mention 25 watt charging, but the charging rate has never crossed 15 watts. While the specifications mention PPS charging, it is actually some samsung proprietary method.3. The CPU might be fast, but the interface is extremely slow, loading an app takes 2 to 3 times longer that my 3 to 4 year old budget phones.4. The Samsung interface is difficult at best, transfer from old phone can be done only by using a proprietary Samsung app and required about 8 factory resets (the factory reset also is painful as I have to login to email and authorize etc.).
Horrible  Samsung phone software update k baad ph on hi nhi hota h .... No service is provided by customer care
I am giving my honest review after 1 month of use.Why Buy: Pros: Low Cost, Good Processor, Samsung Software, Android 12 + 2 years of update & Samsung confidence. No complaint with DisplayCons: Bulky, Heavy, Average Camera.Pros:1) Processor is best for its class. No lag while scrolling 10000 products in a app. Does not require you to empty your Ram by clean memory ( Like Mi etc)2) Good battery and fast charging.3) Decent Display. I have compared it with Mi Amoled, this one is far far better.4) I am a fan of Samsung Software: swipe left sms,swipe right call, Screenshot, Keyboard, Call end recall with other sim, themes, folder, secure folder and what not. I can't live without Samsung Software.5) Confidence in hardware. I used My last phone Samsung S7 for 5 years 3 months. At last due to obsolete software I sold it. Had to change Battery only once. Even the charger is working. The cable worked for 4+ years. That is Samsung. Mi, Oppo Vivo will go to hospital. Samsung won't. Camera software super. Floating menu very good. They are the best can be compared to apple. If apple and Samsung are 1st and 2nd the Rest are 5th 6th 7th. Noone comes in 3rd 4th 5thCons:1) Too bulky. It should be atleast 10% thinner and 20 gram lighter. 6.3 inch is big enough. Any app you watch video the sides are black because of the phone is too long. Why make such phones that have this big screens?2) A buyer of 15000 budget will keep phone in cover. Side mounter finger print does not work fine in cover. If we press more the power button clicks. If we press less than finger print does not match. It takes around 7-10 days to get used it.Suggestion: let the finger print reader be on back side than on side.3) 6000 mah without 25watt charger is pain. 15 watt charger take 2.5 hours to charge. 25 watt takes 1 hour. You must buy a fast charger.
Well at this price point this phone is definitely a good buy for anyone,And here are few points why you should or should not consider this phoneECOSYSTEMSo the first reason to buy this phone is, you get to entry samsung's ecosystem, for this price that's a great deal, you get most of flagship features in the software. The highlights being link to windows which works really well, alt+z, and secure folder.CAMERACamera on this device is something to go for especially the main sensor it clicks really good pictures, packed with flagship camera app features it's a strong unit to get some nice clicks, ultra wide is definitely a bit soft but it can hold it's own in good lighting conditions and most surprising  is the macro camera it takes really good shots keeping in mind it's a mere 2mp camera. It's a great a reliable camera which won't let you down.PERFORMANCEPerformance on this device is good exynos 1280 chip is definitely upto the mark with the competition and mostly performs better in benchmarking apps. But there's some slight lag every now and then which is due to software and I hope it'll ve fixed really soon, samsung is really good at delivering updates. Gaming as for now is good not anything you might wanna brag about, but yeah software optimization would do the game, and 120hz makes it even better both in day to day use and for gaming.BATTERYBattery on this device is very dependable if you're a light to medium user it'll last you easily two days or slightly less than that. This battery's a behemoth it can take whatever you throw at it.SCREENNow some people might complain about it but to be honest it's a good screen it produces crisp and accurate colors with good contrast and brightness levels so no complaints from my sideSo if you want to buy a good phone at this price definitely consider this as an option. You'll enjoy the experience!
I wanted to buy a phone for so long as I broke my OnePlus 3t phone. After days of research, I though Samsung would be a good choice but I was SO SO SO WRONG!!! I have made the worst decision.1. At first, you'd think the phone will do good but it does not except for doing okay, lookwise.2. 6000 mah battery goes for around 1.5 day without much use which should have gone for at least 2 days.3. Camera quality is worst as I know for sure that my Oneplus 3t camera quality was awesome. The pictures at pixelated and very bad.4. Display quality is okay considering the price.5. I thought 8 GM ram would be good option and phone will be fast but it is NOT. If you are a quick user then I bet your hands will move faster than the phone can respond.6. Fingerprint reader takes about 1 second before the phone finally unlocks.7. Face authentication is very bad. I have to try multiple times before it can read my face and unlock the phone.8. A lot of customization features are missing on the phone like - no option to display network speed, or infinite scroll on the apps screen, among few to name.9. Touch responses are late.10. Lots of unwanted apps pre installed which I don't think anyone wants them. I mean there is a playstore and user can install them anytime they want. Why does Samsung pre-installs unnecessary apps on their phone. You will miss the stock android option here.Overall, this is disaster from Samsung and it is better to choose another brand, probably OnePlus if they have made improvement to their cell phones now.I know a lot of users like to buy good brand phone but the reality is that all the companies, nowadays are seriously falling short on customer expectations and past few years all the companies have given bad to worst mobile phones. Samsung is one of those companies where few years ago, you could buy their smartphones without worrying but this is not the case now.I would highly suggest all the buyers to choose wisely and don't give a blind eye for any brand especially Samsung now as they are loosing customer focus. I don't know but the way they are launching one phone after the other,  it looks like they are not at all focusing on how the product will perform after few days, weeks, months, let alone years of testing.It's a shame for a big company like Samsung to just roll out a device without even thinking about it's customers!
Only mobile phone and both side x tupe cable recived . Earphone and adopter not recieved in this box
Better to provide all basic accessories with the product
Got Samsung M33 5G ,6gb/128gb of 17999 at net price of Rs.15999 under an offer of Rs.2000 instant discount from ICICI credit card on its launching day.Delivery got on 12Apr22.Fantastic phone....Look wise,User interphase,speed & almost all the features at this price.Samsung well stablished brand is an extra advantage.Look wise stunning.
Those who already own a c type adaptor please go ahead it's a nice phone bcoz it's samsung. The most wonderful thing is smart switch feature which can easily transfer hassle free all your data from your old phone to this one. The new feature of reverse charging allows you to either charge your mobile or make it a power bank for other ctype phones. Coz they had given a c to c type cable. Camera is decent and sound and display is at par.The only single point I m taking away from this is the absence of c type charger which costs around 1k. Had it been included I would have given 5/5.I m already using galaxy m32 5g and comparatively the selfish camera of m32 is better than this and shoots natural color.But I loved it for the reverse charging feature and best battery of 6000mA. Which I think is the most important feature in the long run. Also there is an SD card slot given separate from 2 sim slot. No hybrid
I have been using for more than a months. Battery is good. Camera is good quality.  Till now it has never hanged. I did not find it slow.  Works very well.
Looks nice, premium inhand feel.Little bit heavy bicouse 6000 MAH battery.No back cover and charger in this box.Fut phone is owesome....
This is a great phone for affordable price. Battery, camera and 120hz display are great. This is also 5G bandwidth ready.Cons: The accidental touch on fingerprint sensor on the side keeps us locked out for 30sec to 1 min. If this would have been in the back side, it would have been great. But this is still a great phone for good price.
This phone is provided Knox security and secure folder this is real best battery back up is goodOverview value for money
Very cheap marketing by samsung, no charger in box. Copying from apple. Always copy gopd things not bad one.
WOW!!!!What a buy!!!Don't regret a single penny !All worth it.EXCELLENT phone!
Very good phone.  has all features needed within budget. worth the price. nice color, user friendly. happy with Samsung.
This phone is very good . Pictures  are good . Performance  is alsovery good. Highly  recommend.
Display is good. Battery life is very good. Built quality is average, could have been better.
Average phone. If you do not want to buy Chinese crap then only buy this one...
the only annoying thing about the phone is the bloatware(random apps which are downloaded automatically) but i have disabled that and now its not an issue, i am very much satisfied with the product.
All functions are excellent. Battery backup is superb. Camera quality also good.
Actually this device is not good for me i used OnePlus for 2 year and this is is not a strong device
phone battery is very poor because phone charge in 3 hours and completely discharged in 10 hours
Great product

I've purchase Samsung M30S, M21, M31S and M50 smartphones for me and my relatives. After 14 to 18 months, out of 6 smarthones, 4 smartphones suddenly started to restart mysteriously. I took 3 phones to the Samsung Authorized Service Centre and after checking the phones the technician confirmed that it is hardware issue and it would cost between INR 5500 to INR 9500 (for different models).I've burnt my fingers very badly with these crap devices. Please do not buy M series phones from Samsung.
It's just one and half year I purchased Samsung Galaxy M31, and It is getting auto restart...when visited Samsung Store at 6:30 on 25-06-2022, they clearly denied to attend even though working hours are 10am to 8pm. After that, when I requested them executive said we will update the software in your phone and if it doesn't get resolved then need to replace motherboard which will cost 5k to 6k.If Company like Samsung having this type of Mobile Quality then what can we expect from other companies? Mobile gets dysfunctional within span of one and half year. Even it is ignorable if costing is less...Please provide some solution
Bought it today. Find it cool and smooth. Best features in this budget....Nice mobile.Display only tft. If it is amoled it is great mobile.After 2 weeks usage, it is working exelent. I am satisfied with this more performanceCustomer image
Bought on the day of launchDecent batteryGreat touch responseDisplay is goodCamera Quality is goodNo lags5g phone in budgetCould have included charger aswell and adjusted the Price.

Very useful and ease to operate. MS office is really handy.

Having a miserable life after buying M-series phone at Rs.15999 on 15 August 2020. It's a very bad decision to choose Exynos over Snapdragon, even Mediatek is better.For the people, who bought on or before September 2020, having a hectic experience with this handset. Customer care will ask you for motherboard replacement which is at payable basis, it will cost around Rs.6600 - 9000. Most probably after the September 2020 update received motherboard got malfunctioned. You may search about the issue on Google / Samsung Community and you will see 90% users are crying for the same issue.Never buy Samsung.
Like it
Good product
From begging I have been using samsung brand mobile. It's screen is very beautiful. Most utility mobile.
Why adapter is not there else take it data cable alsoI think you made directly charging through data cable only
A sleek, stylish yet light handset with good memory/storage.
Phone is nice....bt charger is not provided with it.......bt otherwise phone is good......battery life and camera are too good with such price.....
Good one
Product that I got is good n the package is also good. But delivery executive is not responding properly in delivering package. Delivery Executive is arguing regarding the mode of pay. He is not accepting cash in delivery and arguing to pay in gpay.
Great battery life and also very good performance. Screen quality is very good and camera quality is also very good.
Nice phone with good battery life and camera quality!
Good quality product.
Mobile camera and specs are good.
worst product i m facing battery drainage problem and even the quality of camera is not good
Recomend
Great product, with excellperfimance for  overwhole basic smart phone use. Amazing discount offer with Amazon. Live the Samsung experience.
Very impressive smart phone from Samsung.  I feel so happy I got my dream phone within 21000 Rs. The performance of camera , processor , memory, features and all are so good. Thanks to Samsung and Amazon
I bought M31 mobile last year from amazonbut it got stopped working and I visited samsung service center they said warranty period got over and I need to pay Rs 7100 for changing new mother board then i came to know that this is a common problem for all the M series so please dont buy this product
Not good,
Awesome nice quality 👍 product delivered rating 100 percentage genuinely product delivered
Exellent features and easy to use
The battery lasts long. That was the requirement for my mother and this serves the purpose. The display is fabulous and fingerprint reader is fast and good. Sound is loud enough too. Camera was never a priority for us, but even that was good. Overall, a very nice product for your parents if you want to get one at this cost.
Good phone .

Thanks
I am writing this review after using it 3 months.. All things are good but Camera quality is not good..  Price also dropped from 16500 to 13000 within 3 months.. This really hurt
Very good product
Good battery backupNice and smooth displayCamera is good
Other than lcd screen it is perfect and trendy
Amazing
Worth buying it this product finishing is very good and price is very reasonable
Excellent
Exellent camera quality was good,battery life wowsine
Writing this after using it for a week. Dispaly, camera, battery everything is good. Back cover is really awesome looks great.Samsung should bundle the charger too. It is not about money, it is about customers may buy or use a wrong charger and it affects the battery of the phone. So better to bundle the proper original charger
it is the best phone I ever had with so much features like amazing camera , display , battery backup , gaming experience , video quality and the design every thing is top notch within such low price range.
Good
Very good product 👌
Got 5G in USA an India. Great product and item as described.
No issues found good phone
Exchange value is too low !! Better not offer it. Someone who can afford to buy this product would not need your exchange offer !!!
I would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them – or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes – but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement – which is entirely non-negotiable – is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf – primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‘immersive listening experience’ and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers – because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone – but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.
Very good
Best phone in this price range, voice focus is value added feature of this phone. Overall a best phone bt yes u not got charger or any other gadget with this phone.
The phone is good. I have been using it for the last few days. Picture quality is good , sound is also good as well as the camera . There is no adapter with the phone but it is already mentioned at the time of purchase.
Good battery life, camera. Processor is ok and charger not in the box
Average
GOOD
Received diffective mobile and taking long time replacement the phone.
Overall phone is good but battery draining so fast. I things the background activity processing of this mobile is not good.
For 17k it’s a good purchase  Additions like 5g 6000ma battery C type charging are few of the plus points. The TFT screen looks perfectly ok almost like an Amoled.  Use any existing charger. No need for 25w charger  Only problem is charging may take 2-3 hrs.
Best phone in this range, Buatiful camera for selfie lovers. Good battery backup Easy to use Side finger scanner, Best memory options you can use micro sd card for extra memory. You can enjoy Dolby audio functions.
Excellent budget friendly phone bought it for my father .camera is okay but when doing what's app video call the front camera is bit not clear as specified in the description feels so blurry but when we take pictures or selfie it it ok .Not sure why is it like thatValue for moneyI'm very happy I chose this one
Í bought m31s on 2 aug 2021, and used it one year.Phone is very slow means as compare to other rival it's responding slo.Battery is quite good but camera not up to the mark.After one year suddenly hanged and restart in every 2 min. I have also visit samsung care they said motherboard crashed and repair cost approx 9k.Not able to under stand a well known brand phone motherboard crashed in exactly 1 year 20 days....... Warranty also expired.If you are going to buy any samsung mobile please don't, go for other brands like Vivo oppo realme OnePlus they are giving same features in lessor price
Nice phone got it for Rs.13,000 during sale.Battery life, fingerprint and 120hz screen is best for this budget
Best 5G phone by samsung in low price. Must try if you budget is low.
Nice Camera quality, Good battery life... Very timely delivery. Product is worth buying. 😊Only drawback is that adapter is not there and you need to purchase it.. otherwise it's fine and good phone in this budget.I was confused with realme 9 pro and samsung m33. Went for m33 and I'm happy with the phone..

Designed for customers who want to purchase a 5G-enabled smartphone under Rs 20,000, the Samsung Galaxy M33 5G offers all the essential features. Powered by an Exynos processor, the smartphone houses a big battery with fast charging support. The 5G smartphone runs Android 12 and claims to deliver a smooth performance. We used the Samsung Galaxy M33 5G for some time and here’s our complete reviewDESIGNSamsung Galaxy M33 5G has borrowed its designed aesthetics from the other Galaxy M-series smartphones. The smartphone comes with a plastic design. The rear panel of the smartphone is made of glossy plastic which attracts fingerprints. Like the other Galaxy M series smartphones, this one also houses a quad-rear camera placed inside a square module. The front is dominated by a 6.6-inch display and an 8MP selfie shooter. The right side of the smartphone is home to the power button and volume rockers. The smartphone comes equipped with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor which means that the fingerprint sensor is embedded in the power button. The left side is home to a SIM card tray and the USB Type C charging port is placed at the bottom. The smartphone does offer a clean and elegant design for its price tag. Despite a large display and a big battery the smartphone is quite sleek and light in weight.
